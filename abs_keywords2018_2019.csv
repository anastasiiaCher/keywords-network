"Are We Exposed to the Same “News” in the News Feed? An empirical analysis of filter bubbles as information similarity for Danish Facebook users      In the backdrop of interests in social media news and polarization the aim of this study is to examine to what extent we are exposed to the same “news” in the News Feed? The article defines news not from a classical position but from the content that is judged relevant to the user and made visible by the algorithm. The study examines filter bubbles as information similarity and more specifically nonoverlapping content segments in a unique snapshot dataset of 14 days of personal Facebook News Feeds for 1,000 Danes mirroring the Danish Facebook population. Deploying methods to analyze both link sources and content semantics the study finds that less than 10% in the link source analysis and 27.8% in the semantic analysis are in a filter bubble. The article tests and discusses suitable conceptual and empirical thresholds for information similarity that can inspire future studies. The best significant predictors for …","filter, unique snapshot dataset, content segments, information similarity, social media news, filter bubbles, news feed, empirical analysis, danish facebook users"
"Using SPARQL–the practitioners’ viewpoint  A number of studies have analyzed SPARQL log data to draw conclusions about how SPARQL is being used. To complement this work, a survey of SPARQL users has been undertaken. Whilst confirming some of the conclusions of the previous studies, the current work is able to provide additional insight into how users create SPARQL queries, the difficulties they encounter, and the features they would like to see included in the language. Based on this insight, a number of recommendations are presented to the community. These relate to predicting and avoiding computationally expensive queries; extensions to the language; and extending the search paradigm.","sparql users, insight, users, sparql log, additional insight, queries"
"Motivating Students to Enhance Their Knowledge Levels Through Personalized and Scrutable Visual Narratives  Continuous learning and development have been shown to be directly impacted by poor engagement. With the issue of poor engagement of learners with their course content when using Online Learning Environments (OLEs) still at large, this research aims to analyze the influence that visual narratives could have on encouraging students to study and improve their knowledge levels, and thereby support their continuous learning and development. Interactive and explorable visualizations have been commonly used in OLEs to support students’ continuous learning, development and engagement by highlighting their coverage of course content, presenting the tasks completed and their performance, displaying the students learning model and showing peer comparisons. However, personalized visual narratives that present student knowledge levels which can be scrutinized and challenged have not been …","students, visual narratives"
"Mapping ICS Materials: Interactive, Connected, and Smart Materials  In the last years, new classes of advanced materials are emerging, influenced by computing, Internet of Things, and hybridization of design with science. These materials are overpassing conventional smart materials, by presenting additional degrees of intelligence. These are ICS Materials, an acronym for Interactive, Connected, and Smart Materials. While research centers around the world are experimenting with these new materials, there is the need to reflect on their definition, develop a classification, and identify constraints, potentials, and their impact on design. This paper is a step in this direction and provides the initial results of a basic research project focused on studying ICS Materials. In this paper, we provide the theoretical foundations and present a tentative map for them. This map is the result of an ongoing process of analysis of about one hundred best examples and practices. In conclusion …","new classes, smart materials, ics materials, research centers"
"YAKE! collection-independent automatic keyword extractor  In this paper, we present YAKE!, a novel feature-based system for multi-lingual keyword extraction from single documents, which supports texts of different sizes, domains or languages. Unlike most systems, YAKE! does not rely on dictionaries or thesauri, neither it is trained against any corpora. Instead, we follow an unsupervised approach which builds upon features extracted from the text, making it thus applicable to documents written in many different languages without the need for external knowledge. This can be beneficial for a large number of tasks and a plethora of situations where the access to training corpora is either limited or restricted. In this demo, we offer an easy to use, interactive session, where users from both academia and industry can try our system, either by using a sample document or by introducing their own text. As an add-on, we compare our extracted keywords against the output …","corpora, yake, multilingual keyword extraction, system, single documents"
"A Text Feature Based Automatic Keyword Extraction Method for Single Documents  In this work, we propose a lightweight approach for keyword extraction and ranking based on an unsupervised methodology to select the most important keywords of a single document. To understand the merits of our proposal, we compare it against RAKE, TextRank and SingleRank methods (three well-known unsupervised approaches) and the baseline TF.IDF, over four different collections to illustrate the generality of our approach. The experimental results suggest that extracting keywords from documents using our method results in a superior effectiveness when compared to similar approaches.

"Application of domain engineering to generate customized information dashboards  Information dashboards play a key role in analyzing and visualizing data about a specific topic or domain. In essence, these dashboards display information and enable users to reach insights and make informed decisions. However, end users can have several necessities that are different from each other, including the displayed information itself or other design features. For these reasons, a domain engineering approach is proposed in order to produce customized dashboards adapted to singular requirements of every involved user (or group of users) by the parameterization of features, presentation components and data sources, obtaining a software product line of information dashboards. The creation of a product line would increase productivity, maintainability and traceability regarding the evolution of the dashboards’ requirements. To validate this approach, a case study of its application in the …","application, requirements, information dashboards, domain engineering, specific topic, users"
"A landscape of design: interaction, interpretation and the development of experimental expressive interfaces  This short paper presents the initial research insights of an ongoing research project that focuses upon understanding the role of landscape, its use as a resource for designing interfaces for musical expression, and as a tool for leveraging ethnographic understandings about space, place, design and musical expression. We briefly discuss the emerging research and reasoning behind our approach, the site that we are focusing on, our participatory methodology and conceptual designs. This innovative research is envisaged as something that can engage and interest the conference participants, encourage debate and act as an exploratory platform, which will in turn inform our research, practice and design.","landscape, experimental expressive interfaces, initial research insights, musical expression"
"Using digital medical collections to support radiology training in e-learning platforms  This work is focused on using the huge amount of medical cases available in medical digital collections to support specific radiology training courses, particularly addressed to medical residents. Such support is based on retrieving information items from these extant digital collections and generating instructional resources that can be deployed in the resident training context. The key element for this information management is a tool called Clavy, which retrieves pieces of content in medical collections and allows hospital tutors to generate educational resources easily under standard specifications and work with them in the most popular e-learning platforms. An example of a radiology course was implemented in Moodle to demonstrate the Clavy approach to the generation of training resources and their use in e-Learning platforms.","specific radiology training courses, digital medical collections, radiology training, resources"
"Automatic Creation of a Virtual/Augmented Gallery Based on User Defined Queries on Online Public Repositories  Virtual museums are becoming increasingly popular, especially thanks to the recent spread of low-cost immersive technologies enabling a richer technology-based cultural offer. However, creating a virtual museum commonly requires a lot of effort, especially if a certain visual quality is required.  The aim of the project described in this paper is to verify the effectiveness of automatic strategies to create a virtual museum of paintings, whose digital images are retrieved directly from repositories freely available in the network based on specific user queries. The same approach is then applied in order to create an augmented reality application transforming any environment, purposely instrumented with markers, in a virtual museum.","lowcost immersive technologies, virtual museums, user defined queries, automatic creation, augmented gallery, online public repositories"
"Comparing Different Storytelling Approaches for Virtual Guides in Digital Immersive Museums  Virtual museums are becoming increasingly popular, especially thanks to the recent spread of low-cost immersive technologies enabling even small cultural realities to enrich their technology-based offer. The growing availability of computational power and high-quality visual elements enables the use of virtual characters in order to add depth to the virtual visit experience, up to nowadays often limited to the exploration of lifeless environments. This paper presents a pilot study aimed at investigating the positive effects that the use of avatars can provide to a virtual cultural experience, proposing a virtual museum with three different alternatives of storytelling, including one featuring virtual humans, and comparing the results in terms of engagement and understanding of the proposed content.

"Quantifying retrieval bias in Web archive search A Web archive usually contains multiple versions of documents crawled from the Web at different points in time. One possible way for users to access a Web archive is through full-text search systems. However, previous studies have shown that these systems can induce a bias, known as the retrievability bias, on the accessibility of documents in community-collected collections (such as TREC collections). This bias can be measured by analyzing the distribution of the retrievability scores for each document in a collection, quantifying the likelihood of a document’s retrieval. We investigate the suitability of retrievability scores in retrieval systems that consider every version of a document in a Web archive as an independent document. We show that the retrievability of documents can vary for different versions of the same document and that retrieval systems induce biases to different extents. We quantify this bias …","web, web archive, bias, versions, retrievability scores, retrieval bias, systems"
"Greedy Rectilinear Drawings A drawing of a graph is greedy if for each ordered pair of vertices u and v, there is a path from u to v such that the Euclidean distance to v decreases monotonically at every vertex of the path. The existence of greedy drawings has been widely studied under different topological and geometric constraints, such as planarity, face convexity, and drawing succinctness. We introduce greedy rectilinear drawings, in which each edge is either a horizontal or a vertical segment. These drawings have several properties that improve human readability and support network routing. We address the problem of testing whether a planar rectilinear representation, i.e., a plane graph with specified vertex angles, admits vertex coordinates that define a greedy drawing. We provide a characterization, a linear-time testing algorithm, and a full generative scheme for universal greedy rectilinear representations, i.e., those for which …","vertex, graph, greedy rectilinear"
"Electroweak production of two jets in association with a Z boson in proton–proton collisions at  13TeV A measurement of the electroweak (EW) production of two jets in association with a  boson in proton-proton collisions at  is presented, based on data recorded in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9. The measurement is performed in the  final state with  including electrons and muons, and the jets j corresponding to the quarks produced in the hard interaction. The measured cross section in a kinematic region defined by invariant masses , , and transverse momenta  is , in agreement with leading-order standard model predictions. The final state is also used to perform a search for anomalous trilinear gauge couplings. No evidence is found and limits on anomalous trilinear gauge couplings associated with dimension-six operators are given in the framework of an effective …","leadingorder standard model predictions, proton collisions, anomalous trilinear gauge couplings, electroweak production, final state, proton, jets"
"Simply the Best: Minimalist System Trumps Complex Models in Author Profiling A simple linear SVM with word and character n-gram features and minimal parameter tuning can identify the gender and the language variety (for English, Spanish, Arabic and Portuguese) of Twitter users with very high accuracy. All our attempts at improving performance by including more data, smarter features, and employing more complex architectures plainly fail. In addition, we experiment with joint and multitask modelling, but find that they are clearly outperformed by single task models. Eventually, our simplest model was submitted to the PAN 2017 shared task on author profiling, obtaining an average accuracy of 0.86 on the test set, with performance on sub-tasks ranging from 0.68 to 0.98. These were the best results achieved at the competition overall. To allow lay people to easily use and see the value of machine learning for author profiling, we also built a web application on top our models.","minimal parameter tuning, character ngram features, simple linear svm"
"Rediscovering Isotype from a Cognitive Perspective Almost 100 years ago, Otto Neurath developed the Isotype (International System of Typographic Picture Education) method to communicate statistical information to the broad public in an intuitive, pictorial way. It translates numerical data into arrangements of repeated pictograms. This method is still well-used in information design and data journalism. Neurath’s original publications contained a lot of assumptions on how Isotype diagrams are processed by recipients: e.g. they can be understood easily, because pictograms are processed in the same way as everyday observations of the same concepts. But documented empirical proof was entirely missing. We present a model for the reception of Isotype-like diagrams from a cognitive perspective. This model includes Isotype’s positive effects of countability, iconicity and ancillary semantic information on graph comprehension.

"Migration Experiences: Acknowledging the Past, and Sustaining the Present and Future Australia is recognised as one of the world’s most culturally and ethnically diverse nations. Immigration has historically played an important role in the nation’s economic, social and cultural development. There is a pressing need to find innovative technological and archival approaches to deal with the challenge to digitally preserve Australia’s migrant heritage, especially given the ageing of the European communities that were the first to come under the postwar mass migration scheme. This paper reports on plans for a national collaborative project to develop the foundational infrastructure for a dynamic, interoperable, migrant data resource for research and education. The Migration Experiences platform will connect and consolidate heterogeneous collections and resources and will provide an international exemplar underscoring the importance of digital preservation of cultural heritage and highlighting …","cultural development, archival approaches, diverse nations, migrant heritage, future australia, migrant data resource, migration experiences"
"Genome properties in 2019: a new companion database to InterPro for the inference of complete functional attributes Automatic annotation of protein function is routinely applied to newly sequenced genomes. While this provides a fine-grained view of an organisms functional protein repertoire, proteins, more commonly function in a coordinated manner, such as in pathways or multimeric complexes. Genome Properties (GPs) define such functional entities as a series of steps, originally described by either TIGRFAMs or Pfam entries. To increase the scope of coverage, we have migrated GPs to function as a companion resource utilizing InterPro entries. Having introduced GPs-specific versioned releases, we provide software and data via a GitHub repository, and have developed a new web interface to GPs (available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties). In addition to exploring each of the 1286 GPs, the website contains GPs pre-calculated for a representative set of proteomes; these results can be used to …","protein function, finegrained view, new companion, multimeric complexes, genome properties, coordinated manner, interpro, entries"
"What do farmers weed control decisions imply about glyphosate resistance? Evidence from surveys of US corn fields BACKGROUND The first case of glyphosate‐resistant weeds in the United States was documented in 1998, 2 years after the commercialization of genetically engineered herbicide‐resistant (HR) corn and soybeans. Currently, over 15 glyphosate‐resistant weed species affect US crop production areas. These weeds have the potential to reduce yields, increase costs, and lower farm profitability. The objective of our study is to develop a behavioral model of farmers weed management decisions and use it to analyze weed resistance to glyphosate in US corn farms. RESULTS On average, we find that weed control increased US corn yields by 3700 kg ha−1 (worth approximately $US 255 ha−1) in 2005 and 3500 kg ha−1 (worth approximately $US 575 ha−1) in 2010. If glyphosate resistant weeds were absent, glyphosate killed approximately 99% of weeds, on average, when applied at the label rate in HR production …","weed management decisions, united states, weed control decisions, glyphosate resistance, production"
"HIV-1 drug resistance before initiation or re-initiation of first-line ART in eight regions of Mexico: a sub-nationally representative survey Background HIV pretreatment drug resistance (PDR) to NNRTIs in persons initiating ART is increasing in Mexico. Objectives To compare HIV PDR in eight sub-regions of Mexico. Patients and methods A large PDR survey was implemented in Mexico (September 2017–March 2018) across eight sub-regions. All larger clinics (which provide ART to 90% of all initiators) were included, allocating sample size using the probability-proportional-to-size method. Both antiretroviral-naive and prior antiretroviral-exposed persons were included. HIV PDR levels were estimated from pol Sanger sequences obtained at a WHO-designated laboratory. Results A total of 2006 participants were enrolled from 74 clinics. PDR to NNRTIs was higher than to other drug classes (P < 0.0001), crossing the 10% threshold in the North-East, East, South-West and …","art, larger clinics, hiv pdr, initiation, firstline art, drug, hiv"

"The association between psychological factors and breastfeeding behaviour in women with a body mass index (BMI)≥ 30 kg m− 2: a systematic review Breastfeeding can play a key role in the reduction of obesity, but initiation and maintenance rates in women with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥30 kg m−2 are low. Psychological factors influence breastfeeding behaviours in the general population, but their role is not yet understood in women with a BMI ≥30 kg m−2. Therefore, this review aimed to systematically search and synthesize the literature, which has investigated the association between any psychological factor and breastfeeding behaviour in women with a BMI ≥30 kg m−2. The search identified 20 eligible papers, reporting 16 psychological factors. Five psychological factors were associated with breastfeeding behaviours: intentions to breastfeed, belief in breast milks nutritional adequacy and sufficiency, belief about others infant feeding preferences, body image and social knowledge.

"The bile salt sodium taurocholate induces Campylobacter jejuni outer membrane vesicle production and increases OMV‐associated proteolytic activity Campylobacter jejuni, the leading cause of bacterial acute gastroenteritis worldwide, secretes an arsenal of virulence‐associated proteins within outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). C. jejuni OMVs contain three serine proteases (HtrA, Cj0511, and Cj1365c) that cleave the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) tight and adherens junction proteins occludin and E‐cadherin, promoting enhanced C. jejuni adhesion to and invasion of IECs. C. jejuni OMVs also induce IECs innate immune responses. The bile salt sodium taurocholate (ST) is sensed as a host signal to coordinate the activation of virulence‐associated genes in the enteric pathogen Vibrio cholerae. In this study, the effect of ST on C. jejuni OMVs was investigated. Physiological concentrations of ST do not have an inhibitory effect on C. jejuni growth until the early stationary phase. Coculture of C. jejuni with 0.1% or 0.2% (w/v) ST stimulates OMV production, increasing …","jejuni omvs, outer membrane vesicle production, proteins, bacterial acute gastroenteritis, campylobacter jejuni, outer membrane vesicles, intestinal epithelial cell, serine proteases, salt sodium, campylobacter"
"‘Business! Solidity! Publicity!’: Speculation, Commodification, and Affect in Martin Chuzzlewit Charles Dickens’s novel Martin Chuzzlewit (1844) can be read as a retrospective narrative which seeks to understand how the Panic of 1837 and the global economic crisis that followed in its wake happened, though it does not offer reassurance. Rather than any broad-ranging narrative of comforting teleology that explains how the panic fits into acceptable economic orthodoxy, Martin Chuzzlewit zooms in on the deeply personal, fundamentally subjective and unconscious processes which precede a panic. This article shows how Martin Chuzzlewit denaturalizes the acquired sociocultural self-evidence of confidence through an examination of its exploitability and studies the ways in which Martin Chuzzlewit represents confidence as asserting itself through affective heuristic processes.","business, martin chuzzlewit, acceptable economic orthodoxy"
"Transparent Fused Visualization of Surface and Volume Based on Iso-Surface Highlighting Computer Graphics technology enables a three-dimensional representation of object’s shape and inner structure. It is widely used in the field of visualization and simulation such as computer-aided design, scientific visualization, and medical simulation. Recent studies on implicit surface generation from shape measured three-dimensional point cloud data provide precise and refined surface visualization for complex objects from buildings and tangible heritages to the internal structure of the human body. However, to understand and analyze the structural characteristics of complex shapes, conventional methods, which visualize the whole object with one criterion, could not produce satisfactory results. A more comprehensive visualization method that extracts and highlights the edges and feature regions of a complex object is desired.

"The visual digital turn: Using neural networks to study historical images Digital humanities research has focused primarily on the analysis of texts. This emphasis stems from the availability of technology to study digitized text. Optical character recognition allows researchers to use keywords to search and analyze digitized texts. However, archives of digitized sources also contain large numbers of images. This article shows how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used to categorize and analyze digitized historical visual sources. We present three different approaches to using CNNs for gaining a deeper understanding of visual trends in an archive of digitized Dutch newspapers. These include detecting medium-specific features (separating photographs from illustrations), querying images based on abstract visual aspects (clustering visually similar advertisements), and training a neural network based on visual categories developed by domain experts. We argue that …","sources, images, optical character recognition, neural networks"
"Creating Suitable Tools for Art and Architectural Research with Historic Media Repositories Due to the ongoing digitization, digital libraries are used more and more by art and architectural historians.

"CITEWERTs: A System Combining Cite-Worthiness with Citation Recommendation Due to the vast amount of publications appearing in the various scientific disciplines, there is a need for automatically recommending citations for text segments of scientific documents. Surprisingly, only few demonstrations of citation-based recommender systems have been proposed so far. Moreover, existing solutions either do not consider the raw textual context or they recommend citations for predefined citation contexts or just for whole documents. In contrast to them, we propose a novel two-step architecture: First, given some input text, our system determines for each potential citation context, which is typically a sentence long, if it is actually “cite-worthy.” When this is the case, secondly, our system recommends citations for that context. Given this architecture, in our demonstration we show how we can guide the user to only those sentences that deserve citations and how to present recommended …","combining citeworthiness, scientific documents, citewerts, system, citation recommendation"

Experiences from Projecting Software Quality Using a Reference Set Effective management of a portfolio of software projects may include ranking them with respect to various qualitative criteria. Diversity of projects in terms of their size, maturity and domain poses additional requirements for adopting a quality evaluation process. At first, to provide a convincing argumentation for project improvements, it is important to extract relevant quality features. Secondly, strong and weak aspects of a project could be identified by showing their relevance compared to other projects. In the paper we present experiences from applying a method of ranking software projects based on practical cases. We discuss the relevancy of features used for comparison and analyze various aggregation methods used for comparing projects of similar nature.",software projects
"An approach for exploring a video via multimodal feature extraction and user interactions Exploring the content of a video is typically inefficient due to the linear streamed nature of its media and the lack of interactivity. Video may be seen as a combination of a set of features, the visual track, the audio track and transcription of the spoken words, etc. These features may be viewed as a set of temporally bounded parallel modalities. It is our contention that together these modalities and derived features have the potential to be presented individually or in discrete combination, to allow deeper and effective content exploration within different parts of a video in an interactive manner. A novel system for video exploration by offering video content as an alternative representation is proposed. The proposed system represents the extracted multimodal features as an automatically generated interactive multimedia webpage.

"Leverage the Learning Behaviour of Students in Online Courses with Personalised Interventions Feedback is a vital element for effective learning as it helps students to understand the subject being studied and give them clear instructions on how to improve their learning. It has also been stated that feedback is strongly related to student achievement and improve the self-awareness, enthusiasm and motivation of students for learning. As a result, it is a challenging problem for modern online learning systems to provide suitable feedback to students that is tailored to their learning needs and support different aspects of their learning.

"Using acknowledgement data to characterize funding organizations by the types of research sponsored: the case of robotics research Funded research has been linked to academic production and performance. While the presence of funding acknowledgements may serve as an indicator of quality to some extent, we still lack tools to evaluate whether funding agencies allocate resources to novel and innovative research rather than mature fields. We address this issue in the present study by using bibliometrics. In particular, we exploit the citation network properties of academic articles to classify specific research fields into four categories: change maker, breakthrough, incremental, and matured. We then use funding acknowledgement information to identify the sponsors involved in each research type to characterize funding agencies. We focus our analysis on the robotics field in order to reveal international trends of financial acknowledgements.

"Drawing planar graphs with many collinear vertices Given a planar graph G, what is the maximum number of collinear vertices in a planar straight-line drawing of G? This problem resides at the core of several graph drawing problems, including universal point subsets, untangling, and column planarity. The following results are known: Every n-vertex planar graph has a planar straight-line drawing with  collinear vertices; for every n, there is an n-vertex planar graph whose every planar straight-line drawinghas  collinear vertices; every n-vertex planar graph of treewidth at most two has a planar straight-line drawingwith  collinear vertices. We extend the linear bound to planar graphs of treewidth at most three and to triconnected cubic planar graphs, partially answering two problems posed by Ravsky and Verbitsky. Similar results are not possible for all bounded treewidth or bounded degree planar graphs.

"Evaluating the impact of OCR errors on topic modeling Historical documents pose a challenge for character recognition due to various reasons such as font disparities across different materials, lack of orthographic standards where same words are spelled differently, material quality and unavailability of lexicons of known historical spelling variants. As a result, optical character recognition (OCR) of those documents often yield unsatisfactory OCR accuracy and render digital material only partially discoverable and the data they hold difficult to process. In this paper, we explore the impact of OCR errors on the identification of topics from a corpus comprising text from historical OCRed documents. Based on experiments performed on OCR text corpora, we observe that OCR noise negatively impacts the stability and coherence of topics generated by topic modeling algorithms and we quantify the strength of this impact.","documents, ocr errors, material, font disparities, historical documents, orthographic standards, character recognition"
"Constructing a Recipe Web from Historical Newspapers Historical newspapers provide a lens on customs and habits of the past. For example, recipes published in newspapers highlight what and how we ate and thought about food. The challenge here is that newspaper data is often unstructured and highly varied. Digitised historical newspapers add an additional challenge, namely that of fluctuations in OCR quality. Therefore, it is difficult to locate and extract recipes from them. We present our approach based on distant supervision and automatically extracted lexicons to identify recipes in digitised historical newspapers, to generate recipe tags, and to extract ingredient information. We provide OCR quality indicators and their impact on the extraction process. We enrich the recipes with links to information on the ingredients. Our research shows how natural language processing, machine learning, and semantic web can be combined to construct a rich dataset …","newspapers, recipe web, challenge, historical newspapers, ingredient information"
"What was this Movie About this Chick? In recent decades, information retrieval research has slowly expanded its focus to address the wealth of complex search requests present in our work and leisure environments. A better understanding of such complex needs could aid in the design of more effective, domain-specific search engines. In this paper we take a first step towards such domain-specific understanding. We present an analysis of a random sample of 1000+ complex book and movie search requests posted in the LibraryThing and Internet Movie Database forums. A coding scheme was developed that captures the 29 different relevance aspects expressed in these requests. We find that while the identified relevance aspects are remarkably similar for complex book and movie requests, their relative occurrence does vary considerably from domain to domain.","complex book, domainspecific search engines, relevance, information retrieval research"
"The transformation of the research process in history of architecture through the use of digital technologies In recent decades, the use of digital technologies not only has transformed the way in which research on architectural heritage is conducted, but it has also expanded the possibilities of generating ever more interdisciplinary projects. The increase of the range of open tools, with more functional and user-friendly interfaces, has made possible to identify and visualise previously invisible evidence, synthesise and map temporal information and combine data from heterogeneous sources to generate new data and hypotheses. They have also provided a stimulating setting for raising questions on buildings, cities and territory, as well as the agents interacting with them. The aim of this article is to demonstrate the change, during the process and the practice, of research on history of architecture with the use of digital technologies. To do so, we address a number of issues such as objectivism/subjectivism, data usability …","research process, temporal information, architectural heritage, userfriendly interfaces, invisible evidence, interdisciplinary projects, data, digital technologies, open tools, transformation, heterogeneous sources"
"Low-Investment, Realistic-Return Business Cases for Learning Analytics Dashboards: Leveraging Usage Data and Microinteractions In recent years, Learning Analytics (LA) is finding more and more practical adoption, alongside of continued research interest. However, questions about the impact of LA applications and their underpinning in educational science are still being raised, impeding viability of some LA projects at larger scale. Within this paper we describe two examples using student-facing LA dashboards (LAD) deployed at scale at a relatively low cost. Leveraging data collected by the dashboards themselves, usage data (N = 4070 students) and in-dashboard microinteractions (N = 367 students), we try to put the impact question in perspective. We suggest that when investment is kept limited, a business case with modest but realistic expatiations of returns may be feasible.","usage data, learning analytics, learning analytics dashboards, realisticreturn business cases, lowinvestment"
"Feature-Highlighting Transparent Visualization of Laser-Scanned Point Clouds Based on Curvature-Dependent Poisson Disk Sampling In recent years, with the development of 3D laser-measurement technology, digital archiving is being carried out as one of the efforts to leave cultural assets to posterity around the world. The laser-scanned point clouds are large-scale and precisely record complex 3D structures of the cultural assets. Accordingly, such point clouds are used in research field of visualization to support analysis and use of the assets. As representative examples of visualization, there are feature-highlighting and transparent visualization. The quality of visualization highly depends on distributional uniformity, that is, uniformity of inter-point distances. However, laser-scanned point clouds are usually distributional bias data, which makes it impossible to visualize with high quality. In previous studies, making point distances uniform by Poisson disk sampling, the quality of transparent visualization can be improved.

"Music Artist Similarity: An Exploratory Study on a Large-Scale Dataset of Online Streaming Services In supporting music search, online music streaming services often suggest artists who are deemed as similar to those listened to or liked by users. However, there has been an ongoing debate on what constitutes artist similarity. Approaching this problem from an empirical perspective, this study collected a large-scale dataset of similar artists recommended in four well-known online music steaming services, namely Spotify, Last.fm, the Echo Nest, and KKBOX, on which an exploratory quantitative analysis was conducted. Preliminary results reveal that similar artists in these services were related to the genre and popularity of the artists. The findings shed light on how the concept of artist similarity is manifested in widely adopted real-world applications, which will in turn help enhance our understanding of music similarity and recommendation.","largescale dataset, online music streaming services, music search, online streaming services, music artist similarity, similar artists, exploratory"
"Toward a model for digital tool criticism: Reflection as integrative practice In the past decade, an increasing set of digital tools has been developed with which digital sources can be selected, analyzed, and presented. Many tools go beyond key word search and perform different types of analysis, aggregation, mapping, and linking of data selections, which transforms materials and creates new perspectives, thereby changing the way scholars interact with and perceive their materials. These tools, together with the massive amount of digital and digitized data available for humanities research, put a strain on traditional humanities research methods. Currently, there is no established method of assessing the role of digital tools in the research trajectory of humanities scholars. There is no consensus on what questions researchers should ask themselves to evaluate digital sources beyond those of traditional analogue source criticism. This article aims to contribute to a better understanding …","model, digital tools, integrative practice, key word search, humanities research, data selections, digital tool criticism, scholars"
"A Recommender System in Ukiyo-e Digital Archives for Japanese Art Novices In the past decades, many digital archives are developed for storing cultural materials such as arts and books. Art Research Center (ARC) at Ritsumeikan University has developed digital archives for various Japanese ancient cultural materials. The ARC digital archive preserves a large amount of Ukiyo-e artworks. In this paper, we propose a recommender system that is suitable for the ARC Ukiyo-e digital archive, to help the users obtaining the interested Ukiyo-e artworks conveniently. The recommender algorithm is based on the user log data, which is easy to obtain and represents the user behaviors. The proposed method is named CARC, which uses restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) for collaborative filtering to initialize the recommendation list, and then uses content-based filtering (CBF) for generating more explicit recommendation list. The proposed recommender system is effective to extract the …","japanese art novices, recommender system, ukiyoe digital"
"Ownership Stamp Character Recognition System Based on Ancient Character Typeface In the process of digital archive development of Asian ancient books, ownership stamps and the annotations should be retrievable to provide the origin and versions of the books and the important support of book collection culture. The development of ownership stamp image databases, the text in the ownership stamp, and the background description of the owner will not only narrow the gap between non-professionals and seal culture and art, but also enable people to know more about ownership stamps, which are types of cultural heritage. Meanwhile, it also provides a convenient comparison and reference tool for professional scholars. However, the variety of the written languages used on ownership stamps and the various layouts of the texts and patterns create difficulties for developing such a database.

"Situation-dependent data quality analysis for geospatial data using Semantic technologies In this paper we present a new way to evaluate geospatial data quality using Semantic technologies. In contrast to non-semantic approaches to evaluate data quality, Semantic technologies allow us to model situations in which geospatial data may be used and to apply costumized geospatial data quality models using reasoning algorithms on a broad scale. We explain how to model data quality using common vocabularies of ontologies in various contexts, apply data quality results using reasoning in a real-world application case using OpenStreetMap as our data source and highlight the results of our findings on the example of disaster management planning for rescue forces.

"SageBook: Toward a cross-generational social network for the Jewish sages’ prosopography In this research we devised and implemented a semi-automatic approach for building a SageBook–a cross-generational social network of the Jewish sages from the Rabbinic literature. The proposed methodology is based on a shallow argumentation analysis leading to detection of lexical–syntactic patterns which represent different relationships between the sages in the text. The method was successfully applied and evaluated on the corpus of the Mishna, the first written work of the Rabbinic Literature which provides the foundation to the Jewish law development. The constructed prosopographical database and the network generated from its data enable a large-scale quantitative analysis of the sages and their related data, and therefore might contribute to the research of the Talmudic literature and evolution of the Jewish thought throughout the two last millennia.","crossgenerational social network, semiautomatic approach, jewish sages, rabbinic literature, shallow argumentation analysis, sagebook"
"In Vitro Assessment of Nasal Insufflation of Comminuted Drug Products Designed as Abuse Deterrent Using the Vertical Diffusion Cell In vitro evaluation of abuse deterrent formulations (ADFs) is a challenge since real abuse situations are variable and ADF technology is evolving. Specifically, an assessment of an ADF to deter nasal insufflation would be valuable. In this study, a vertical diffusion cell (VDC) was used to evaluate polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based tablets manipulated by three different forces. The commercially available products Oxycontin®, an ADF, Opana®, and metoprolol tartrate tablet formulations made in our laboratory were studied. Particle size distribution and percent recovery of manipulated tablets were measured. Grinding produced the lowest recovery and the smallest particle size distribution. Drug release was examined using a VDC by placing the dry comminuted particles on an enclosed wetted cellulose membrane. Dispensing dry particles on a VDC is atypical but includes some key features associated with an …","tablet formulations, real abuse situations, vertical diffusion cell, abuse deterrent, comminuted drug products, vitro assessment, adf technology, particle size distribution, nasal insufflation"
"Disruption in neural phase synchrony is related to identification of inattentional deafness in real‐world setting Individuals often have reduced ability to hear alarms in real world situations (e.g., anesthesia monitoring, flying airplanes) when attention is focused on another task, sometimes with devastating consequences. This phenomenon is called inattentional deafness and usually occurs under critical high workload conditions. It is difficult to simulate the critical nature of these tasks in the laboratory. In this study, dry electroencephalography is used to investigate inattentional deafness in real flight while piloting an airplane. The pilots participating in the experiment responded to audio alarms while experiencing critical high workload situations. It was found that missed relative to detected alarms were marked by reduced stimulus evoked phase synchrony in theta and alpha frequencies (6–14 Hz) from 120 to 230 ms poststimulus onset.

"An Analysis of the Interaction Between Intelligent Software Agents and Human Users Interactions between an intelligent software agent (ISA) and a human user are ubiquitous in everyday situations such as access to information, entertainment, and purchases. In such interactions, the ISA mediates the user’s access to the content, or controls some other aspect of the user experience, and is not designed to be neutral about outcomes of user choices. Like human users, ISAs are driven by goals, make autonomous decisions, and can learn from experience. Using ideas from bounded rationality (and deploying concepts from artificial intelligence, behavioural economics, control theory, and game theory), we frame these interactions as instances of an ISA whose reward depends on actions performed by the user. Such agents benefit by steering the user’s behaviour towards outcomes that maximise the ISA’s utility, which may or may not be aligned with that of the user.

"Ocean Analysis by Tsunami Simulation of the Nankai Trough Massive Earthquake Large-scale tsunamis have a major impact on the natural environment. Therefore, it is important to predict a large-scale tsunami. Recently, large-scale tsunami simulation using a supercomputer has been performed for prediction. By analyzing large-scale tsunami simulation data obtained from the supercomputer, it is expected that damage will be minimized. The purpose of this paper is to propose a visualization method for analysis support of simulation results. There are three kinds of visualization methods proposed. The first method is simultaneous visualization of a majority of feature quantities based on an opacity transfer function obtained by extending the HSV color space. This is aimed at observing the mutual relationship between feature quantities obtained by simulation. The second method is to create volume data in which time-series images are superimposed in the time axis direction (XYT space …","largescale tsunami, largescale tsunami simulation, ocean analysis, tsunami simulation, natural environment, visualization method"
"Lemmatization for Ancient Languages: Rules or Neural Networks? Lemmatisation, which is one of the most important stages of text preprocessing, consists in grouping the inflected forms of a word together so they can be analysed as a single item. This task is often considered solved for most modern languages irregardless of their morphological type, but the situation is dramatically different for ancient languages. Rich inflectional system and high level of orthographic variation common to these languages together with lack of resources make lemmatising historical data a challenging task. It becomes more and more important as manuscripts are being extensively digitized now, but still remains poorly covered in literature. In this work, I compare a rule-based and a neural network based approach to lemmatisation in case of Early Irish (Old and Middle Irish are often described together as “Early Irish”) data.","important stages, neural networks, historical data, lemmatization, single item, ancient languages, rich inflectional system"

"Metropolis, 20th century apparatus. Dystopia as objectification of urban fear Metropolis (1927) by Fritz Lang represents the first urban dystopia in the history of 20th-century movies. The archetype of the city comes from cultural exchange between the representations of sci-fi literature and the scientific discoveries of the early 20th century: the vertical city by H. G. Wells Tales of space and time, the second industrial revolution, the so-called machine civilization, the theories of the Bauhaus and the Avant-garde. The osmosis between the hard sciences and the humanities forms a dynamic map, which is constructed by the present reality and which determines the design model of the future. But Metropolis is also a powerful representation of man, the transfiguration of the human microcosm in the urban macrocosm, a metaphor of the uncertain human ontological status.

"Natural Interaction in Virtual Reality for Cultural Heritage Now that virtual reality has finally become a customer ready product, museums can use this new mean to enhance their exhibitions. The main problem however is that such a tool was not thought for casual users, and to adapt this new technology to short experiences such as the ones museums could provide, it is necessary to reduce the adaptation time to the new mean. In this paper, we discuss how removing physical controllers in favour of visually-tracked virtual hands could significantly reduce the time needed by casual users to adapt to new experiences, underlying the current technological limitations both in terms of technology and design.","casual users, new experiences, virtual reality, natural interaction, cultural heritage, new technology, visuallytracked virtual hands, museums"

"Rate Your Physician: Findings from a Lithuanian Physician Rating Website Physician review websites are known around the world. Patients review the subjectively experienced quality of medical services supplied to them and publish an overall rating on the Internet, where quantitative grades and qualitative texts come together. On the one hand, these new possibilities reduce the imbalance of power between health care providers and patients, but on the other hand, they can also damage the usually very intimate relationship between health care providers and patients. Review websites must meet these requirements with a high level of responsibility and service quality. In this paper, we look at the situation in Lithuania: Especially, we are interested in the available possibilities of evaluation and interaction, and the quality of a particular review website measured against the available data.

"From the Punchmen to Pugin’s Gothics: The Broad Road to a Sentimental Death in The Old Curiosity Shop Political Economy, Literature and the Formation of Knowledge, 1720–1850 provides an important historical corrective to our understanding of the necessity of the idea of political economy, the return of politics to economics. It complicates the dominant assumptions of contemporary economics, its turn to finance and to technocracy, and offers new ways of historicizing the discipline in its fullest social, political, cultural, and philosophical contexts. It is a collection that understands very well the irony that attends on the fact that contemporary economics’ biggest problem is that it has no “Adam Smith Problem,” that it retained Smith’s interest in homo economicus at the cost of the moral and political philosophies that could made sense of him.

"Let’s chat: the art of virtual reference instruction Purpose This study aims to evaluate the instances of information literacy instruction within the virtual reference system of a Canadian university library. Design/methodology/approach Coding and analysis of a sample of chat transcripts over the course of one academic year have been used. Findings The analysis indicated that over 50 per cent of virtual reference interactions do not lend themselves to information literacy instruction. An average of 23.6 per cent of interactions included information literacy instruction and the preferred methods of instruction were modelling and resource sharing. Originality/value While previous studies have focused on information literacy instruction provided in a virtual reference setting, this study aims to identify not only instances of information literacy but also to better understand the nature of chat queries by codifying instances of a transactional nature. The results could lead to …","literacy instruction, instances, canadian university library, approach coding, chat transcripts"
"Axiomatizing Discrete Spatial Relations Qualitative spatial relations are used in artificial intelligence to model commonsense notions such as regions of space overlapping, touching only at their boundaries, or being separate. In this paper we extend earlier work on qualitative relations in discrete space by presenting a bi-intuitionistic modal logic with universal modalities, called UBiSKt. This logic has a semantics in which formulae are interpreted as subgraphs. We show how a variety of qualitative spatial relations can be defined in UBiSKt. We make essential use of a sound and complete axiomatisation of the logic and an implementation of a tableau based theorem prover to establish novel properties of these spatial relations. We also explore the role of UBiSKt in expressing spatial relations at more than one level of detail. The features of the logic allow it to represent how a subgraph at a detailed level is approximated at a coarser level.","space, biintuitionistic modal logic, qualitative relations, discrete space, artificial intelligence, spatial relations"
"Detecting Shifts in Public Opinion: A Big Data Study of Global News Content Rapid changes in public opinion have been observed in recent years about a number of issues, and some have attributed them to the emergence of a global online media sphere 1, 2. Being able to monitor the global media sphere, for any sign of change, is an important task in politics, marketing and media analysis. Particularly interesting are sudden changes in the amount of attention and sentiment about an issue, and their temporal and geographic variations. In order to automatically monitor media content, to discover possible changes, we need to be able to access sentiment across various languages, and specifically for given entities or issues. We present a comparative study of sentiment in news content across several languages, assembling a new multilingual corpus and demonstrating that it is possible to detect variations in sentiment through machine translation. Then we apply the method on a …","media analysis, public opinion, global news content rapid, languages, shifts"
"Towards Recommending Interesting Content in News Archives Recently, many archival news article collections have been made available to wide public. However, such collections are typically large, making it difficult for users to find content they would be interested in. Furthermore, archived news articles tend to be perceived by ordinary users as having rather weak attractiveness and being obsolete or uninteresting. In this paper, we propose the task of finding interesting content from news archives and introduce two simple methods for it. Our approach recommends interesting content by comparing the information written in the past with the one from the present.","news archives, interesting content, ordinary users, task, weak attractiveness, collections, content, simple methods"
"The identity of “chromium malate” Recently, several studies on the effects of a compound named “chromium malate,” with the proposed formula “Cr2malate3·xH2O” where x = 3.5 or 5, on the health of healthy and diabetic rats have appeared. However, the compound is poorly characterized, and knowing the identity of this material could be important in the interpretation of the previous and of future studies on the effects of this compound in animals. Consequently, the synthesis, characterization, and identity of this material were explored. A combination of spectroscopic, magnetic, and elemental analyses and mass spectral studies reveal that the compound is probably a polymer, not a discrete molecule, and does not have the composition previously reported. The repeating unit of the polymer possesses an antiferromagnetically coupled trinuclear Cr(III) core. The current study suggests that previous reports on chromium malate and its effects in …","chromium malate, chromium, compound, identity"
"To cite, or not to cite? Detecting citation contexts in text Recommending citations for scientific texts and other texts such as news articles has recently attracted considerable amount of attention. However, typically, the existing approaches for citation recommendation do not explicitly incorporate the question of whether a given context (e.g., a sentence), for which citations are to be recommended, actually “deserves” citations. Determining the “cite-worthiness” for each potential citation context as a step before the actual citation recommendation is beneficial, as (1) it can reduce the number of costly recommendation computations to a minimum, and (2) it can more closely approximate human-citing behavior, since neither too many nor too few recommendations are provided to the user. In this paper, we present a method based on a convolutional recurrent neural network for classifying potential citation contexts. Our experiments show that we can significantly …","text recommending citations, citation contexts, recommendation, scientific texts, news articles, citation recommendation, potential citation context"
"Hierarchical Correlation Clustering in Multiple 2D Scalar Fields Sets of multiple scalar fields can be used to model many types of variation in data, such as uncertainty in measurements and simulations or time‐dependent behavior of scalar quantities. Many structural properties of such fields can be explained by dependencies between different points in the scalar field. Although these dependencies can be of arbitrary complexity, correlation, i.e., the linear dependency, already provides significant structural information. Existing methods for correlation analysis are usually limited to positive correlation, handle only local dependencies, or use combinatorial approximations to this continuous problem. We present a new approach for computing and visualizing correlated regions in sets of 2‐dimensional scalar fields. This paper describes the following three main contributions: (i) An algorithm for hierarchical correlation clustering resulting in a dendrogram, (ii) a generalization of …","significant structural information, scalar quantities, hierarchical correlation clustering"
"Durrington walls and the Stonehenge Hidden Landscape Project 2010–2016 Since 2010 the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project (SHLP) has undertaken extensive archaeological prospection across much of the landscape surrounding Stonehenge. These remote sensing and geophysical surveys have revealed a significant number of new sites and landscape features whilst providing new information on many previously known monuments. The project goal to integrate multimethod mapping over large areas of the landscape has also provided opportunities to re‐interpret the landscape context of individual monuments and, in the case of the major henge at Durrington Walls, to generate novel insights into the structure and sequence of a monument which has attracted considerable research attention over many decades.

"Towards Understanding Cross-Cultural Crowd Sentiment Using Social Media Social media such as Twitter has been frequently used for expressing personal opinions and sentiments at different places. In this paper, we propose a novel crowd sentiment analysis for fostering cross-cultural studies. In particular, we aim to find similar meanings but different sentiments between tweets collected over geographical areas. For this, we detect sentiments and topics of each tweet by applying neural network based approaches, and we assign sentiments to each topic based on the sentiments of the corresponding tweets. This permits finding cross-cultural patterns by computing topic and sentiment correspondence. The proposed methods enable to analyze tweets from diverse geographical areas sentimentally in order to explore cross-cultural differences.","geographical areas, personal opinions, crowd sentiment, diverse geographical areas, sentiment"
"Combinatorial lentiviral gene delivery of pro‐oligodendrogenic factors for improving myelination of regenerating axons after spinal cord injury Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in paralysis below the injury and strategies are being developed that support axonal regrowth, yet recovery lags, in part, because many axons are not remyelinated. Herein, we investigated strategies to increase myelination of regenerating axons by overexpression of platelet‐derived growth factor (PDGF)‐AA and noggin either alone or in combination in a mouse SCI model. Noggin and PDGF‐AA have been identified as factors that enhance recruitment and differentiation of endogenous progenitors to promote myelination. Lentivirus encoding for these factors was delivered from a multichannel bridge, which we have previously shown creates a permissive environment and supports robust axonal growth through channels. The combination of noggin+PDGF enhanced total myelination of regenerating axons relative to either factor alone, and importantly, enhanced functional recovery …","endogenous progenitors, mouse sci model, combinatorial lentiviral gene delivery, recovery lags"
"DiTaxa: Nucleotide-pair encoding of 16S rRNA for host phenotype and biomarker detection Summary Identifying distinctive taxa for microbiome-related diseases is considered key to the establishment of diagnosis and therapy options in precision medicine and imposes high demands on the accuracy of microbiome analysis techniques. We propose an alignment- and reference- free subsequence based 16S rRNA data analysis, as a new paradigm for microbiome phenotype and biomarker detection. Our method, called DiTaxa, substitutes standard OTU-clustering by segmenting 16S rRNA reads into the most frequent variable-length subsequences. We compared the performance of DiTaxa to the state-of-the-art methods in phenotype and biomarker detection, using human-associated 16S rRNA samples for periodontal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as a synthetic benchmark dataset. DiTaxa performed competitively to the k-mer based state-of-the-art …","host phenotype, nucleotidepair encoding, ditaxa, biomarker detection, distinctive taxa"
"Query-Based Versus Resource-Based Cache Strategies in Tag-Based Browsing Systems Tag-based browsing is a popular interaction model for navigating digital libraries. According to this model, users select descriptive tags to filter resources in the collections. Typical implementations of the model are based on inverted indexes. However, these implementations can require a considerable amount of set operations to update the browsing state. To palliate this inconvenience, it is possible to adopt suitable cache strategies. In this paper we describe and compare two of these strategies: (i) a query-based strategy, according to which previously computed browsing states are indexed by sets of selected tags; and (ii) a resource-based strategy, according to which browsing states are indexed by sets of filtered resources. Our comparison focused on runtime performance, and was carried out empirically, using a real-world web-based collection in the field of digital humanities.

"The references of references: a method to enrich humanities library catalogs with citation data The advent of large-scale citation indexes has greatly impacted the retrieval of scientific information in several domains of research. The humanities have largely remained outside of this shift, despite their increasing reliance on digital means for information seeking. Given that publications in the humanities have a longer than average life-span, mainly due to the importance of monographs for the field, this article proposes to use domain-specific reference monographs to bootstrap the enrichment of library catalogs with citation data. Reference monographs are works considered to be of particular importance in a research library setting, and likely to possess characteristic citation patterns.

SOCIAL, SCIENTIFIC AND INSTITUTIONAL USES The archival treatment of anthropological data includes, at the same time, conservation operations and enhancement actions for a wide public access. In this perspective, if on the one hand the archivist is called upon to retrace the researchers field adventure from his workstation, on the other hand, researchers are asked to adopt functional methodologies to the future archiving of data. The example of the Luisa Orrus archives that are stored at the university of Cagliari reflects this dual aspect and encourages the wide dissemination of data thanks to the tools of Digital Humanities. The experience of the MMSH (Maison mediterraneenne des sciences de lhomme) phonotheque in Aix-en-Provence and the treatment of subjects common to the two archives - ethnobotany and medical anthropology - is a model and an invitation to the sharing of research data in a Fair Science perspective.

"A diachronic study of historiography The humanities are often characterized by sociologists as having a low mutual dependence among scholars and high task uncertainty. According to Fuchs’ theory of scientific change, this leads over time to intellectual and social fragmentation, as new scholarship accumulates in the absence of shared unifying theories. We consider here a set of specialisms in the discipline of history and measure the connectivity properties of their bibliographic coupling networks over time, in order to assess whether fragmentation is indeed occurring. We construct networks using both reference overlap and textual similarity. It is shown that the connectivity of reference overlap networks is gradually and steadily declining over time, whilst that of textual similarity networks is stable. Author bibliographic coupling networks also show signs of a decline in connectivity, in the absence of an increasing propensity for collaborations.

"Creating Digital Collections: Museum Content and the Public The internet is a valuable asset for making cultural heritage accessible to a broader audience, and in recent years many museums have experimented with methods of sharing their collections online. This move towards a digital presence for museums has raised questions about the role of curators, librarians, and other information professionals in creating and maintaining digital collections. If anyone can collect images, and display them together on their personal website, what work remains for cultural heritage professionals to do? Using data collected from webscraping using Python, we evaluate the explicit metadata associated with online collections of objects created by both the public and museum professionals.

"Electron acceleration to MeV energies at Jupiter and Saturn The radiation belts and magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn show significant intensities of relativistic electrons with energies up to tens of megaelectronvolts (MeV). To date, the question on how the electrons reach such high energies is not fully answered. This is largely due to the lack of high‐quality electron spectra in the MeV energy range that models could be fit to. We reprocess data throughout the Galileo orbiter mission in order to derive Jupiters electron spectra up to tens of MeV. In the case of Saturn, the spectra from the Cassini orbiter are readily available and we provide a systematic analysis aiming to study their acceleration mechanisms. Our analysis focuses on the magnetospheres of these planets, at distances of L > 20 and L > 4 for Jupiter and Saturn, respectively, where electron intensities are not yet at radiation belt levels.

"Extremal curves and surfaces in symmetric tensor fields The visualization of symmetric second-order tensor fields in two or three dimensions is still a challenging task, particularly if global structures of the data are desired. One approach is tensor field topology which provides structures characterizing the behavior of the eigenvector fields. Another widely used approach is analyzing tensor fields by means of scalar invariants, i.e., quantities invariant with respect to changes of the coordinate system. In this case, the selection of the relevant invariants might be difficult. Thus, we propose an approach which analyzes the complete invariant part of the tensor. We define extremal points for tensor fields in a mathematically rigorous way, which form curves for two-dimensional and surfaces for three-dimensional tensor fields. We propose a way to compute extremal curves or surfaces from a suitable set of two or three invariants, respectively.

Surveillance Studies and Literature of the Long 18th Century This essay begins with a general survey of current work in surveillance studies with a particular emphasis on the work in literary studies; it moves then to show the centrality of the 18th century to any account of surveillance or surveillance culture. It concludes with suggestions of how scholars of the literature of the long 18th century might contribute to the field surveillance studies and expand its historical and methodological scope.,"general survey, literature, methodological scope, surveillance culture, 18th century"
"The Novel and WikiLeaks: Transparency and the Social Life of Privacy This essay proposes a shift away from thinking about privacy, in fiction and the world, as concerned with an individual’s interior, toward thinking about it as something that inheres in interpersonal and group interactions. This view of privacy becomes especially visible as both a formal feature and a thematic concern in recent novels that take up WikiLeaks as a topic. These novels—Dave Eggers’s The Circle (2013) and Jonathan Franzen’s Purity (2015)—make revealing attempts to square the competing ideals of governmental transparency and individual privacy. By borrowing from social network analysis, and attending to the ways that these authors describe information flow between characters, this essay describes privacy as a facet of our social and information networks.","formal feature, wikileaks, novels, information, group interactions, transparency, social life"
"Aesthetic Discrimination of Graph Layouts This paper addresses the following basic question: given two layouts of the same graph, which one is more aesthetically pleasing? We propose a neural network-based discriminator model trained on a labeled dataset that decides which of two layouts has a higher aesthetic quality. The feature vectors used as inputs to the model are based on known graph drawing quality metrics, classical statistics, information-theoretical quantities, and two-point statistics inspired by methods of condensed matter physics. The large corpus of layout pairs used for training and testing is constructed using force-directed drawing algorithms and the layouts that naturally stem from the process of graph generation. It is further extended using data augmentation techniques. Our model demonstrates a mean prediction accuracy of 96.48%, outperforming discriminators based on stress and on the linear combination of popular …","layouts, graph layouts, statistics, aesthetic discrimination"
"Integrating Academic and Everyday Learning Through Technology: Issues and Challenges for Researchers, Policy Makers and Practitioners This paper builds on work undertaken over a number of years by a group of international researchers with an interest in the potential of connecting academic and everyday practices and knowledge. Drawing extensively on literature and our own work, we first discuss the challenges around defining informal learning, concluding that learning is multidimensional and has varying combinations of formal and informal attributes. We then highlight the potential of technology for integrating formal and informal learning attributes and briefly provide some exemplars of good practice. We then discuss in depth the challenges and issues of this approach to supporting learning from the perspective of pedagogy, research, policy and technology. We also provide some recommendations of how these issues may be addressed. We argue that for the learner, integration of formal and informal learning attributes should be an …","policy makers, technology, informal learning, challenges, practitioners"
"From Poetic Revolution to the Southern Society: The Birth of Classicist Poetry in Modern China This paper examines the birth of classicist poetry by paying attention to the Southern Society’s (Nanshe) diachronic succession of the late Qing Poetic Revolution. It provides a careful analysis on the novelty of Huang Zunxian’s poetry and shows how the Southern Society transformed Huang’s Europeanized innovation into something that was rooted in both traditional scholarship and modern political discourse. I argue that the poetry of the Southern Society as being more formally conservative than Huang’s; however, spiritually, it represents a kind of progress as it styled itself as the “poetry of the cotton-clothed” (buyi zhi shi)—the “cotton- clothed” stands for the scholars not serving in court. In this regard, its poetry could be seen as modern in spirit. It selectively integrated the traditional and the Western, for pragmatic and utilitarian purposes.","modern china, diachronic succession, classicist poetry, poetic revolution, huang zunxian, southern society"
"Lyricism, the Veneration of Feeling, and Narrative Techniques in the Poetry Talks of the Southern Society This paper examines the voluminous “poetry talks” (shihua) written by Southern Society (Nanshe) members and focuses on two tendencies in these discourses: The general cult of sentimentality and the narrative strategy on women’s poetry. These poetic discourses succeeded the language of traditional literary criticism, but also exhibited ideals of the new epoch. As a rebellion to the Qing imperial standard on measured and learned poetry, Southern Society poets took instead as their role models eccentric and iconoclastic poets who “venerated feelings.” The cult of sentimentality continued the trend of individual liberation from the late Ming and further showed a collective discourse that promoted a new kind of revolutionary subjectivity. These authors were also fond of collecting sentimental stories about female poets. More than being traditional “talented women,” these poets exhibited a diversity of female roles in …","lyricism, poets, traditional literary criticism, southern society, female, general cult, new epoch, poetry talks, veneration, narrative techniques"
"The reception in Spain of African literature written in English: statistical data generation using the specialised bibliographic database BDAFRICA This paper explores the reception in Spain of African literature written originally in English by focusing on BDAFRICA, a bibliographical database of works of fiction by African-born authors published in Spain, in Spanish between 1972 and 2014. It provides a critical reflection on the constraints of defining the object of study when African literature is discussed, due to the complexity and heterogeneity of such literature. It also proposes a concise historiographical journey through the Western canon formation of African literature in English. Additionally, it evidences the lack of quantitative studies on the reception in Spain of African literature in English. To cater to this need, the aim of this paper is to report and analyse the groundbreaking statistical data the database itself provides by following a descriptive approach.

"Quantitative fine-grained human evaluation of machine translation systems: a case study on English to Croatian This paper presents a quantitative fine-grained manual evaluation approach to comparing the performance of different machine translation (MT) systems. We build upon the well-established multidimensional quality metrics (MQM) error taxonomy and implement a novel method that assesses whether the differences in performance for MQM error types between different MT systems are statistically significant. We conduct a case study for English-to-Croatian, a language direction that involves translating into a morphologically rich language, for which we compare three MT systems belonging to different paradigms: pure phrase-based, factored phrase-based and neural. First, we design an MQM-compliant error taxonomy tailored to the relevant linguistic phenomena of Slavic languages, which made the annotation process feasible and accurate. Errors in MT outputs were then annotated by two annotators …","human evaluation, machine translation systems, quantitative, manual evaluation approach, systems"
"On Detecting Online Radicalization Using Natural Language Processing This paper suggests a new approach for radicalization detection using natural language processing techniques. Although, intuitively speaking, detection of radicalization from only language cues is not trivial and very debatable, the advances in computational linguistics together with the availability of large corpus that allows application of machine learning techniques opens us new horizons in the field. This paper advocates a two stage detection approach where in the first phase a radicalization score is obtained by analyzing mainly inherent characteristics of negative sentiment. In the second phase, a machine learning approach based on hybrid KNN-SVM and a variety of features, which include 1, 2 and 3-g, personality traits, emotions, as well as other linguistic and network related features were employed. The approach is validated using both Twitter and Tumblr dataset.","approach, radicalization detection, new approach, online radicalization, machine learning techniques, language processing"
"Too Much Information and the KWIC This paper takes a media archaeology look at the development of the Keyword-in-Context (KWIC) display by Peter Luhn and how the KWIC helped automate ways of disseminating information about information. The paper takes the development of the KWIC as an example of the development of a knowledge technology that frames knowledge in a certain way. The KWIC and other information technologies transform knowledge into information that can be quantified and processed. Developments like the KWIC are the beginning of language engineering—a new way of conceiving of text as information to be manipulated. Finally, the paper proposes a way of reflecting on developments like the KWIC by replicating these early technologies. Replications can take the form of demonstration devices or knowledge things that expose the processes in our infrastructure.","media archaeology, peter luhn, early technologies, kwic, knowledge"

This research purposefully chose 6 entries and developed a framework to evaluate their performance in accuracy, breadth, depth, informativeness, conciseness and objectiveness. The result shows that: Wikipedia is superior in most cases while Baidu Baike is a little better in the entries on Chinese history. The operating mechanism is the main reason for it. The result implies that in the field of history, well-established online encyclopedias can be reliable for common users although improvement such as developing operating mechanisms is still needed.","baidu baike, historical entries, representative online encyclopedias, chinese history, operating mechanism, comparison, wikipedia"
"Applications of duplicate detection in music archives: from metadata comparison to storage optimisation This work focuses on applications of duplicate detection for managing digital music archives. It aims to make this mature music information retrieval (MIR) technology better known to archivists and provide clear suggestions on how this technology can be used in practice. More specifically applications are discussed to complement meta-data, to link or merge digital music archives, to improve listening experiences and to re-use segmentation data. To illustrate the effectiveness of the technology a case study is explored. The case study identifies duplicates in the archive of the Royal Museum for Central Africa, which mainly contains field recordings of Central Africa. Duplicate detection is done with an existing Open Source acoustic fingerprinter system. In the set, 2.5% of the recordings are duplicates. It is found that meta-data differs dramatically between original and duplicate showing that merging meta-data …","segmentation data, clear suggestions, duplicate detection, storage optimisation, applications, central africa, royal museum, music archives, metadata comparison, mature music information retrieval, digital music archives"
"Smart Tourism Routes Based on Real Time Data and Evolutionary Algorithms Tourism is an industry that has been growing rapidly in the last few years and it is expected that it will continue to grow. Due to the evolution of technology, mobile applications are being increasingly used in all kinds of industries, being one of them tourism. Presently there are already a few mobile applications used to increase the experience of the user when visiting a place, but these mobile applications lack some important features. This paper describes the development of a mobile application with integrated routing algorithms used to increase the experience of the tourists when visiting the city of Avila, Spain. The tourist will have at their disposal real time information about all the monuments available for visit, a full set of predefined circuits with different visit times and degrees of difficulty and also the possibility to create an optimized or personalized circuit combining the user preferences such as visiting …","mobile applications, predefined circuits, visit, smart tourism routes, full set, algorithms"
"Modelling regional imbalances in English plebeian migration to late eighteenth‐century London† Using a substantial set of vagrancy removal records for Middlesex (1777–86) giving details of the place of origin of some 11,500 individuals, and analysing these records using a five‐variable gravity model of migration, this article addresses a simple question: from which parts of England did London draw its lower‐class migrants in the late eighteenth century? It concludes, first, that industrializing areas of the north emerged as a competitor for potential migrants—contributing relatively fewer migrants than predicted by the model. Rising wage rates in these areas appear to explain this phenomenon. Second, it argues that migration from urban centres in the west midlands and parts of the West Country, including Bristol, Birmingham, and Worcester, was substantially higher than predicted, and that this is largely explained by falling wage rates and the evolution of an increasingly efficient travel network. Third, for the …","wage rates, vagrancy removal records, west midlands, regional imbalances, migration, english plebeian migration, substantial set, potential migrants"
"Accessing Russian culture online: The scope of digitization in museums across Russia We compare the scope of museum digitization in the Russian Federation, a country with diverse cultural heritage and over 2,300 museums, with the scope of digitization in Europe as measured by the Enumerate Survey of 355 museums from twenty European countries initiated by the Collections Trust, UK, in 2011. Our article shows that the reach and scope of digitization in Russia is lesser than that of European museums. Digitization is mainly done in Russia for inventory purposes. The share of digitized objects published online is comparable to that in Europe if we consider images published on museum websites; however, much content from Russia is not licensed as reusable, partly due to the different legal framework that exists there. The article challenges the perceptions that global heritage collections are becoming more visible and accessible.

"-Stars or On Extending a Drawing of a Connected Subgraph We consider the problem of extending the drawing of a subgraph of a given plane graph to a drawing of the entire graph using straight-line and polyline edges. We define the notion of star complexity of a polygon and show that a drawing  of an induced connected subgraph H can be extended with at most  bends per edge, where  is the largest star complexity of a face of  and h is the size of the largest face of H. This result significantly improves the previously known upper bound of 72|V(H)| 5 for the case where H is connected.We also show that our bound is worst case optimal up to a small additive constant. Additionally, we provide an indication of complexity of the problem of testing whether a star-shaped inner face can be extended to a straight-line drawing of the graph; this is in contrast to the fact that the same problem is solvable in linear time for the case of star-shaped …","star complexity, stars, connected subgraph, entire graph, largest star complexity"
"Fact Checking from Natural Text with Probabilistic Soft Logic We demonstrate a method to support fact-checking of statements found in natural text such as online news, encyclopedias or academic repositories, by detecting if they violate knowledge that is implicitly present in a reference corpus. The method combines the use of information extraction techniques with probabilistic reasoning, allowing for inferences to be performed starting from natural text. We present two case studies, one in the domain of verifying claims about family relations, the other about political relations. This allows us to contrast the case where ground truth is available about the relations and the rules that can be applied to them (families) with the case where neither relations nor rules are clear cut (politics).","fact, family relations, online news, natural text, academic repositories, probabilistic soft, information extraction techniques, verifying claims"
"Nonlocal and multipoint boundary value problems for linear evolution equations We derive the solution representation for a large class of nonlocal boundary value problems for linear evolution partial differential equations (PDE) with constant coefficients in one space variable. The prototypical example of such PDE is the heat equation, for which problems of this form model physical phenomena in chemistry and for which we formulate and prove a full result. We also consider the third‐order case, which is much less studied and has been shown by the authors to have very different structural properties in general. The nonlocal conditions we consider can be reformulated as multipoint conditions, and then an explicit representation for the solution of the problem is obtained by an application of the Fokas transform method. The analysis is carried out under the assumption that the problem being solved is well posed, i.e., it admits a unique solution. For the second‐order case, we also give criteria that …","space variable, pde, constant coefficients, heat equation, explicit representation, solution representation, linear evolution equations"

"Overview of the CLEF-2018 CheckThat! Lab on automatic identification and verification of political claims We present an overview of the CLEF-2018 CheckThat! Lab on Automatic Identification and Verification of Political Claims. In its starting year, the lab featured two tasks. Task 1 asked to predict which (potential) claims in a political debate should be prioritized for fact-checking; in particular, given a debate or a political speech, the goal was to produce a ranked list of its sentences based on their worthiness for fact-checking. Task 2 asked to assess whether a given check-worthy claim made by a politician in the context of a debate/speech is factually true, half-true, or false. We offered both tasks in English and in Arabic. In terms of data, for both tasks, we focused on debates from the 2016 US Presidential Campaign, as well as on some speeches during and after the campaign (we also provided translations in Arabic), and we relied on comments and factuality judgments from                      factcheck.org …","political claims, verification, lab, clef2018 checkthat, debate, automatic identification, speech"
"Historians Experiences Using Digitized Archival Photographs as Evidence Widespread digitization of cultural heritage materials and access to digital tools have altered the scholarly research landscape. For historian scholars who use archival sources to construct arguments, such changes in research environments have undoubtedly influenced the ways in which they work. Using an embedded case study approach, this research seeks to understand how scholarly information practices are changing by exploring the experiences of historians using digitized archival photographs as sources of evidence. How and why are historians deciding to use (or not to use) these sources in their scholarly activities? The findings of this research illustrate what makes experiences meaningful and significant for historians working with archival photographs in digital research environments.","archival photographs, research, evidence widespread digitization, scholarly research landscape, historians, archival sources, cultural heritage materials"

The first chapter gives some context to the field, looking at emotions in historical writing, and emotional historicism in other fields including the social neurosciences. Chapter 2 focuses on ‘words and concepts’, the history of emotion language and its limitations for our enquiries. What can language tell us about the historical experience of emotions?

In this section Lockwood argues that while the presence of juries and witnesses helped to legitimate inquests in the eyes of local communities, the coroner nevertheless remained a creature of the state, essentially pursuing the state’s interests.

"11 Students Tell Me Things162 Morrison links between the software or hardware platform used, the kinds of writing that can be produced on that platform, and the context-specific potential or actual audience associated with it. An essay on the collective writing platform Medium, for example, can draw an audience of strangers into long-form writing and be searched on the Internet, while Facebook status updates are much shorter and visible only to a circumscribed audience of “Friends”—further limited on the basis of invisible algorithmic calculations to optimize news feeds. Second, ethical issues related to personal privacy, intellectual property, and life writing’s fundamental relationality are brought to the fore in this assignment, as students struggle to tell their own stories without disclosing too much of anyone else’s. Along these same lines, as in all assignments that require the production of life-writing, students become acutely aware of the slippery nature of what constitutes a “true story,” the ambiguities of the autobiographical pact, the unreliability of memory, and the sheer quantity of pruning and selection involved in auto/biography. Third, an assignment that has students both producing life writing and then critiquing it opens up a methodological discussion on auto-ethnography, participant ethnography, and surface reading, methods I believe to be crucial to teaching and researching online life writing, methods that can account for and incorporate the subjectivity of the researcher.

A broader understanding is required on how human and non-human intermediaries promote or inhibit user participation. One of the most successful attributes of Hutchinson’s work is the way it brings together digital media and digital ethnographic approaches. With this mix of methods, the author seeks to understand constantly evolving technologies through which we communicate but also the cultural and codified practices that occur across them. In this way, the book also demonstrates the limitations of methods for researchers to investigate new digital environments.

A glaring example is the (de) valorization of ‘national’heritage, as the latter increasingly becomes, thanks to transnational technological developments, a virtual entity and notion. For the past few years, we have all been waiting for the next critical ‘turn’in the digital humanities. Now, with the accelerating dissemination of immersive and virtualizing technologies (VR, AR and so on), poised to become a ‘mass experience’, it seems that the post-ontological ‘turn’is already here. Or is it? Is the ‘virtualization’of everything, to echo Jaron Lanier’s ‘dawn of the new everything’(Lanier 2017), from social relations to our interactions with the natural and built environment, the overarching (critical) question of our time?

"Connected Semantic Concepts as a Base for Optimal Recording and Computer-Based Modelling of Cultural Heritage Objects3D and spectral digital recording of cultural heritage monuments is a common activity for their documentation, preservation, conservation management, and reconstruction. Recent developments in 3D and spectral technologies have provided enough flexibility in selecting one technology over another, depending on the data content and quality demands of the data application. Each technology has its own pros/cons, suited perfectly to some situations and not to others. They are mostly unknown to humanities experts, besides having a limited understanding of the data requirements demanded by the research question. These are often left to technical experts who again have a limited understanding of cultural heritage requirements. A common point of view has to be achieved through interdisciplinary discussions. Such agreements need to be documented for their future references and re-uses. We present a method based on semantic concepts that not only documents the semantic essence of such discussions, but also uses it to infer a guidance mechanism that recommends technologies/technical process to generate the required data based on individual needs. Experts’ knowledge is represented explicitly through a knowledge representation that allows machines to manage and infer recommendations.

"Steampunk and Nineteenth-Century Digital Humanities: Literary Retrofuturisms, Media Archaeologies, Alternate Histories656 nineteenth-century studies, and digital humanities. It argues that steampunk is “a research methodology” and even a “public form of Victorian scholarship that... spread s conversations about the period beyond academia”(4, 169). To Whitson, steampunk is not nostalgic, escapist, or uninformed; instead, its alternate histories help us see history itself as “a punk mashup of voices, both real and imagined, human and non-human,” and as “not linear, but layered, recursive, branching, conjectural, and algorithmic”(191). We can learn, Whitson argues, from alternate history’s “rejection of the linear temporality too-often associated with cultural historicism” and “embrace... the non-human mechanisms whose operational and recursive temporalities impact the lives of human beings in increasingly visible ways”(11).

"Work in the Intersections: A Black Feminist Disability FrameworkA Black feminist disability framework allows for methodological considerations of the intersectional nature of oppression. Our work in this article is twofold: to acknowledge the need to consider disability in Black Studies and race in Disability Studies, and to forward an intersectional framework that considers race, gender, and disability to address the gaps in both Black Studies and Disability Studies. By employing a Black feminist disability framework, scholars of African American and Black Studies, Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, and Disability Studies have a flexible and useful methodology through which to consider the historical, social, cultural, political, and economic reverberations of disability.","disability framework, economic reverberations, methodological considerations"
"Linking Corpus Data to an Excerpt-based Historical DictionaryA Dictionary of Old Norse Prose (ONP) is a digital dictionary that derives originally from an excerpt-based index of around 750,000 citations. This paper describes recent attempts to create two-way links between the growing body of digital texts encoded using TEI XML and the dictionary’s word list, which forms the basis of the published dictionary. The process involves design challenges in bringing together very different digital structures, namely the text in an XML tree structure, and the dictionary in a relational database structure. Because of the very high levels of accuracy demanded by the end-users of the dictionary (particularly researchers in Old Norse studies), the linking process can only be automated for unambiguous cases, with remaining links entered manually. The application and interface that assists this process attempts to minimize the trade-off between automation and accuracy, and adds a range of tools to assist with the human lemmatizing process. We were able to achieve linking of lemmas in 90.4% of instances where the lemma was recorded in the TEI text, with very high levels of accuracy. Where no lemma was recorded, the application allowed an Old Norse scholar to link lemmas to previously unlemmatized words at an average rate of 4-7 seconds per word.","norse, twoway links, digital texts, corpus data, excerptbased index, tei xml"

POOCs highlight different aspects of PLNs, particularly “the four Ps” of research and composing online: POOCs are personal, participatory, professional, and composed of Points of Presence. By combining PLNs with MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), we highlight the similarities between the two, connect PLNs to classrooms, and apply MOOC concepts to the nonvirtual or “meatspace” classroom. At its core, POOCs ask students to invent their own open online university.

"Search for lepton flavour violating decays of the Higgs boson to μ τ and e τ in proton-proton collisions at  TeVA bstract A search for lepton flavour violating decays of the Higgs boson in the μτ and e τ decay modes is presented. The search is based on a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb− 1 of proton-proton collisions collected with the CMS detector in 2016, at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant excess over the standard model expectation is observed. The observed (expected) upper limits on the lepton flavour violating branching fractions of the Higgs boson are ℬ (H→ μτ)< 0.25%(0.25%) and ℬ (H→ e τ)< 0.61%(0.37%), at 95% confidence level.

"Search for  production in the all-jet final state in proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeVA bstract A search is presented for the associated production of a Higgs boson with a top quark pair in the all-jet final state. Events containing seven or more jets are selected from a sample of proton-proton collisions at s= 13 s= 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb− 1. To separate the tt¯ H t t H signal from the irreducible tt¯+ bb¯ t t+ b b background, the analysis assigns leading order matrix element signal and background probability densities to each event. A likelihood-ratio statistic based on these probability densities is used to extract the signal.

"Search for natural supersymmetry in events with top quark pairs and photons in pp collisions at  TeVA bstract Results are presented from a search for natural gauge-mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) in a scenario in which the top squark is the lightest squark, the next-to-lightest SUSY particle is a bino-like neutralino, and the lightest SUSY particle is the gravitino. The strong production of top squark pairs can produce events with pairs of top quarks and neutralinos, with each bino-like neutralino decaying to a photon and a gravitino. The search is performed using a sample of pp collision data accumulated by the CMS experiment at s= 8 s= 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb− 1. The final state consists of a lepton (electron or muon), jets, and one or two photons. The imbalance in transverse momentum in the events is compared with the expected spectrum from standard model processes.

"Crosswalking or Jaywalking? The Visualization of Linked Scientific and Humanities DataA critical aspect of shared data is using an easily accessible interface that is interoperable across a wide range of heritage institutions. An innovative approach to heritage science, where data is generated about the materiality of heritage materials, is linking this data back to a visual rendering of the heritage material to begin a process of linked data and integration between science and humanities. Using the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), the shared canvas data model is being expanded for integrating linked scientific analyses to this digital surrogate. There are challenges with this approach for spectral imaging data due to the additional required layers of metadata in the spectral, spatial and temporal modes, which need to be consistent, and persistent, across sets of canvases.","heritage materials, heritage science, data, heritage institutions"
"Everywhere and Nowhere: Anonymity and Mediation in Eighteenth-Century BritainA fascinating analysis of anonymous publication centuries before the digital age Everywhere and Nowhere considers the ubiquity of anonymity and mediation in the publication and circulation of eighteenth-century British literature—before the Romantic creation of the “author”—and what this means for literary criticism. Anonymous authorship was typical of the time, yet literary scholars and historians have been generally unable to account for it as anything more than a footnote or curiosity. Mark Vareschi shows the entangled relationship between mediation and anonymity, revealing the nonhuman agency of the printed text. Drawing richly on quantitative analysis and robust archival work, Vareschi brings together philosophy, literary theory, and media theory in a trenchant analysis, uncovering a history of textual engagement and interpretation that does not hinge on the known authorial subject. In discussing anonymous poetry, drama, and the novel along with anonymously published writers such as Daniel Defoe, Frances Burney, and Walter Scott, he unveils a theory of mediation that renews broader questions about agency and intention. Vareschi argues that textual intentionality is a property of nonhuman, material media rather than human subjects alone, allowing the anonymous literature of the eighteenth century to speak to contemporary questions of meaning in the philosophy of language. Vareschi closes by exploring dubious claims about the death of anonymity and the reexplosion of anonymity with the coming of the digital. Ultimately, Everywhere and Nowhere reveals the long history of print anonymity so central to the risks and benefits of …","anonymous authorship, fascinating analysis, literary criticism, anonymity, anonymous publication centuries, digital age, mediation, eighteenthcentury"

"Psychological science and virtue epistemology: Intelligence as an interactionist virtueA notable trend in recent virtue theory is the engagement with research in empirical psychology as it bears on central themes in both virtue ethics and virtue epistemology (eg, Alfano 2013; Doris 2015; Fairweather and Montemayor 2013). Ours is another contribution to the confluence of these fields. We aim to expand the body of empirical literature considered relevant to virtue theory beyond the burned-over districts that are the situationist challenges to virtue ethics and epistemology. To do so, we will raise a rather simple-sounding question: why doesn’t virtue epistemology have an account of intelligence? With the exception of Alfano et al.(forthcoming), this essential question has received little attention (eg, Driver 2001: 45; Baehr 2011: 25).","empirical psychology, epistemology, virtue epistemology, psychological science, virtue ethics, central themes"

We propose  predominance tag maps, a layout algorithm that accounts for predominance for arbitrary aggregation granularities. The algorithm is able to utilize the font sizes of the tags as visual variable and it is further configurable to implement aggregation strategies beyond visualizing predominance.

"Planar Graphs of Bounded Degree have Constant Queue NumberA queue layout of a graph consists of a linear order of its vertices and a partition of its edges into queues, so that no two independent edges of the same queue are nested. The queue number of a graph is the minimum number of queues required by any of its queue layouts. A long-standing conjecture by Heath, Leighton and Rosenberg states that the queue number of planar graphs is constant. This conjecture has been partially settled in the positive for several subfamilies of planar graphs (most of which have bounded treewidth). In this paper, we make a further important step towards settling this conjecture. We prove that planar graphs of bounded degree (which may have unbounded treewidth) have constant queue number.A notable implication of this result is that every planar graph of bounded degree admits a three-dimensional straight-line grid drawing in linear volume. Further implications are that every planar graph of bounded degree has constant track number, and that every k-planar graph (ie, every graph that can be drawn in the plane with at most k crossings per edge) of bounded degree has constant queue number.Subjects: Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.

"NETLOGO SIMULATIONS AND THE USE OF TRANSPORT AMPHORAS IN ANTIQUITYA substantial challenge to network studies using amphoras is, perhaps surprisingly, presented by the amphoras themselves. Both our scholarly ancestors and some of our contemporary colleagues have postulated that Greek amphora stamps should be ideal, straightforward data points for quantified studies of ancient shipping (Rostovtzeff 1941, 774–776; Davies 2001, 27–28; cf. Lawall 2005). This is incorrect. Many amphora classes never used stamps and so disappear from such data; others used stamps for certain periods only; still others stamped only a fraction of their jars. Reconciling these and other complications to the amphora record is challenging to say the least. The alternative—treating amphoras like any other ceramic data—encounters the same problems of quantification that impact pottery studies in general (Orton, Tyers, and Vince 1993, 166–181) and, in addition, must contend with the impact of the scholarly love of stamps at the expense of non-stamped sherds. This is not to say that quantified data related to amphoras are entirely inaccessible, but they are not readily at hand from many centers; nor is the most desirable kind of data necessarily obvious.

"The Intellectual Organisation of HistoryA tradition of scholarship discusses the characteristics of different areas of knowledge, in particular after modern academia compartmentalized them into disciplines. The academic approach is often put to question: are there two or more cultures? Is an ever-increasing specialization the only way to cope with information abundance or are holistic approaches helpful too? What is happening with the digital turn? If these questions are well studied for the sciences, our understanding of how the humanities might differ in their own respect is far less advanced. In particular, modern academia might foster specific patterns of specialization in the humanities. Eventually, the recent rise in the application of digital methods to research, known as the digital humanities, might be introducing structural adaptations through the development of shared research technologies and the advent of organizational practices such as the laboratory. It therefore seems timely and urgent to map the intellectual organization of the humanities. This investigation depends on few traits such as the level of codification, the degree of agreement among scholars, the level of coordination of their efforts. These characteristics can be studied by measuring their influence on the outcomes of scientific communication. In particular, this thesis focuses on history as a discipline using bibliometric methods.In order to explore history in its complexity, an approach to create collaborative citation indexes in the humanities is proposed, resulting in a new dataset comprising monographs, journal articles and citations to primary sources.

"‘Women Buried’: Henry Fielding and Feminine AbsenceAccording to Arthur Murphy, Henry Fielding claimed “that he left off writing for the stage when he ought to have begun”. Regardless of the veracity of this attribution (Murphy’s putative closeness and even his actual acquaintance with the writer was challenged from the start), this assessment of Fielding’s drama might equally be applied to his novelistic career. Tom Jones, and even more so Amelia, gestures towards the consolidation of a model of novel writing that strove to endow the genre with the cultural legitimacy that Fielding never ceased to crave. The tragic atmosphere of his last novel can be explained, in part at least, by his aspiration to influence prose fiction so as to render it a medium at once popular and prestigious, something that in his time could only be said of regular dramatic literature.

"A Neurobiological Cross-domain Evaluation Metric for Predictive Coding NetworksAchieving a good measure of model generalization remains a challenge within machine learning. One of the highest-performing learning models is the biological brain, which has unparalleled generalization capabilities. In this work, we propose and evaluate a human-model similarity metric for determining model correspondence to the human brain, as inspired by representational similarity analysis. We evaluate this metric on unsupervised predictive coding networks. These models are designed to mimic the phenomenon of residual error propagation in the visual cortex, implying their potential for biological fidelity. The human-model similarity metric is calculated by measuring the similarity between human brain fMRI activations and predictive coding network activations over a shared set of stimuli. In order to study our metric in relation to standard performance evaluations on cross-domain tasks, we train a multitude of predictive coding models across various conditions. Each unsupervised model is trained on next frame prediction in video and evaluated using three metrics: 1) mean squared error of next frame prediction, 2) object matching accuracy, and 3) our human-model similarity metric. Through this evaluation, we show that models with higher human-model similarity are more likely to generalize to cross-domain tasks. We also show that our metric facilitates a substantial decrease in model search time because the similarity metric stabilizes quickly---in as few as 10 epochs. We propose that this metric could be deployed in model search to quickly identify and eliminate weaker models.","similarity metric, humanmodel similarity, predictive coding, good measure, neurobiological crossdomain evaluation metric, model generalization, crossdomain tasks"
"UG^ 2: A Video Benchmark for Assessing the Impact of Image Restoration and Enhancement on Automatic Visual RecognitionAdvances in image restoration and enhancement techniques have led to discussion about how such algorithms can be applied as a pre-processing step to improve automatic visual recognition. In principle, techniques like deblurring and super-resolution should yield improvements by de-emphasizing noise and increasing signal in an input image. But the historically divergent goals of computational photography and visual recognition communities have created a significant need for more work in this direction. To facilitate new research, we introduce a new benchmark dataset called UG2, which contains three difficult real-world scenarios: uncontrolled videos taken by UAVs and manned gliders, as well as controlled videos taken on the ground. Over 150,000 annotated frames for hundreds of ImageNet classes are available, which are used for baseline experiments that assess the impact of known and unknown …","video benchmark, image restoration, enhancement techniques, computational photography, visual recognition, new research"
"The hidden heritage of Arab libraries: Online catalogs and institutional barriers to discoverabilityAdvances in technology have made access to information about library holdings a seemingly universal feature of interaction with modern libraries. However, this type of access does not exist evenly throughout the world. There is a vast “hidden heritage” contained in Arab libraries without online public access catalogs. This article reports and summarizes findings from research conducted as part of a year-long investigation into international library collaboration in Arab libraries. The research included: (a) a survey of online presence for Arab libraries, (b) a survey of Arab librarians, and (c) focused panel discussions with Arab librarians and library scholars. This study finds that the relatively small online presence of libraries cannot be explained by material factors alone: institutional factors also play an important role in keeping information about library collections offline.","online presence, arab libraries, institutional barriers, hidden heritage, arab librarians, library, online catalogs"
"Visualization of Cultural Heritage Collection Data: State of the Art and Future ChallengesAfter decades of digitization, large cultural heritage collections have emerged on the web, which contain massive stocks of content from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. This increase in digital cultural heritage data promises new modes of analysis and increased levels of access for academic scholars and casual users alike. Going beyond the standard representations of search-centric and grid-based interfaces, a multitude of approaches has recently started to enable visual access to cultural collections, and to explore them as complex and comprehensive information spaces by the means of interactive visualizations. In contrast to conventional web interfaces, we witness a widening spectrum of innovative visualization types specially designed for rich collections from the cultural heritage sector.

"Management of a Multidisciplinary Research Project:  A Case Study on Adopting Agile MethodsAgile methods, initially used by cross-functional teams in software development projects, can also facilitate teamwork in collaborative research projects. For this, project management-related issues need to be addressed, including the challenge of finding practical means for coordinating scientific collaboration, while garnering commitment from all participants. This article explores the utilisation of agile methods by a semi-distributed scientific team, for coordinating a multidisciplinary research project. It examines how these methods can contribute to task coordination in scientific research and highlights key factors for successful adoption of the agile framework in collaborative research projects. Data are collected from a research team, after a 10-week phase of implementing agile methods. Data analysis focuses on the effectiveness of the digital tools used for communication and coordination during the project. The findings indicate a perception that agile methods contribute to coordination and improved teamwork during project development, with less agreement on the utility of some of the tools used. Also, it suggests the importance of involvement of the principal investigator and the role of a facilitator.","agile methodsagile methods, management, coordination, software development projects, collaborative research projects, methods, multidisciplinary research project, crossfunctional teams, agile methods"
"Additionality in US agricultural conservation programsAgricultural conservation programs aim to improve environmental quality by using payments to support voluntary adoption of environmentally sound practices. Supported practices, however, yield additional environmental gain only if they would not have been adopted without payment. We estimate additionality for selected practices using propensity score matching to analyze data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). We find that greater than 95% of off-field structural practices (filter strips, riparian buffers) supported by payments are additional but that less than 50% of conservation tillage payments yield additional adoption. The effect of nutrient management payments varies across nutrient management practices and crops.(JEL Q28, Q52)","sound practices, management, additionality, adoption, conservation, additional environmental gain"
"Institutionalizing Agroecology in France: Social Circulation Changes the Meaning of an Idea.Agroecology has come a long way. In the past ten years, it has reappeared in France throughout the agricultural sector and is now included in public and private strategies and in supportive policies, with collateral interest effects. Is a new “agro-revolution” taking place? To address this issue, using a methodology mixing hyperlink mapping and textual corpora analysis, we focus here on the trajectory of agroecology in various worlds: that of academia, social movements, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that promote international solidarity, research and training institutions and public policies. This trajectory intertwines actors and time lines, with periods in which certain actors play a specific role, and others in which interactions between actors are dominant in terms of coalition advocacy. Some actors play a major role in circulating agroecology as they belong to several different social worlds (eg, academia and …","private strategies, worlds, textual corpora analysis, france, supportive policies, social circulation, agroecology, methodology mixing hyperlink mapping, agricultural sector, collateral interest effects"
"Real-world US healthcare costs of psoriasis for biologic-naive patients initiating apremilast or biologicsAim: Biologics and apremilast have advanced psoriasis management by adding treatment options. This study evaluated persistence, adherence and healthcare costs among biologic-naive patients receiving apremilast or biologics. Methods: Administrative claims data for adults starting apremilast or biologics from 1 January 2013 to 30 June 2016 were matched based on demographics. Results: Apremilast (n= 703) and biologics (n= 1378) had similar baseline characteristics. 12-month persistence and adherence rates were similar. Adjusted total healthcare costs were lower with apremilast versus biologics (p< 0.001) due to lower total outpatient pharmacy costs (p< 0.001).

"Predicting Excessive Post-Operative Blood Loss in Cardiac Surgical Patients Using Platelet MicrovesiclesAim: Post-operative bleeding represents an important complication for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Platelet microvesicles (PMVs) are procoagulant intercellular communicators; with PMV counts and phenotypes being associated with bleeding. Therefore, we evaluated PMVs potential to predict post-operative bleeding in cardiac surgical patients.Method: 25 patients undergoing cardiac surgery had blood taken pre-and post-heparin administration. PMV counts and phenotypes in platelet-poor plasma were analysed using flow cytometry. Phenotypes were determined using the antibodies for CD41a, CD42b, CD61, CD62P, and lactadherin for phospatidylserine quantification. PMV counts were compared to post-operative blood loss and demographics.Result: CD42b+ PMV counts significantly decreased post-heparin administration (p= 0.002).

"Managing In-home Environments through Sensing, Annotating, and Visualizing Air Quality DataAir quality is important, varies across time and space, and is largely invisible. Pioneering past work deploying air quality monitors in residential environments found that study participants improved their awareness of and engagement with air quality. However, these systems fielded a single monitor and did not support user-specified annotations, inhibiting their utility. We developed MAAV--a system to Measure Air quality, Annotate data streams, and Visualize real-time PM2. 5 levels--to explore how participants engage with an air quality system addressing these challenges. MAAV supports collecting data from multiple air quality monitors, annotating that data through multiple modalities, and sending text message prompts when it detects a PM2. 5 spike.

"Alan Lomax’s Cantometrics Project: A comprehensive reviewAlan Lomax’s Cantometrics Project was arguably both the most ambitious and the most controversial undertaking in music and science that the world has known. Its flagship component, Lomax’s “cantometric” analysis of approximately 1,800 songs from 148 worldwide populations using 36 classificatory features, sparked extensive debate. While Lomax responded to some criticisms, neither his final conclusions nor the evidence on which they were based were ever fully made clear. For decades, neither cantometrics nor Lomax’s related projects involving dance, speech, popular music, digital humanities, pedagogy, and activism were widely adopted by other researchers, but there has been a resurgence of interest since Lomax’s death in 2002.

"Choosers: The design and evaluation of a visual algorithmic music composition language for non-programmersAlgorithmic music composition involves specifying music in such a way that it is non-deterministic on playback, leading to music which has the potential to be different each time it is played. Current systems for algorithmic music composition typically require the user to have considerable programming skill and may require formal knowledge of music. However, much of the potential user population are music producers and musicians (some professional, but many amateur) with little or no programming experience and few formal musical skills. To investigate how this gap between tools and potential users might be better bridged we designed Choosers, a prototype algorithmic programming system centred around a new abstraction (of the same name) designed to allow non-programmers access to algorithmic music composition methods. Choosers provides a graphical notation that allows structural elements of key importance in algorithmic composition (such as sequencing, choice, multi-choice, weighting, looping and nesting) to be foregrounded in the notation in a way that is accessible to non-programmers. In order to test design assumptions a Wizard of Oz study was conducted in which seven pairs of undergraduate Music Technology students used Choosers to carry out a range of rudimentary algorithmic composition tasks. Feedback was gathered using the Programming Walkthrough method. All users were familiar with Digital Audio Workstations, and as a result they came with some relevant understanding, but also with some expectations that were not appropriate for algorithmic music work.

"Human vs. automated judgements of cross-cultural musical similarityAlthough MIR has demonstrated great success in automatic analysis of Western music, no study has tested automatic algorithms against perceptual ground-truth data for a global musical sample. It thus remains unknown whether MIR algorithms can be meaningfully applied to automatically compare diverse music from around the world. In this pilot study, we aim to establish ground truth perceptual data on similarity between diverse musical recordings from across the world and use this perceptual data to test the accuracy of existing audio similarity algorithms. Preliminary results (two participants, ten recordings) suggest that perceptual ratings of musical similarity are significantly correlated between participants, but these similarities are only weakly correlated with similarities measured by an automatic algorithm. While this is consistent with more pessimistic assessments of MIR’s current ability to accommodate non-Western music, we hypothesize that collecting more perceptual data, comparing against more algorithms, and creating new algorithms based on more universal musical theories will enable meaningful automatic analysis of all the world’s music within the near future. This would have important implications for our understanding of cross-cultural music diversity, including applications to domains such as music recommendation and cultural heritage preservation.","automatic algorithms, global musical sample, western music, automatic analysis, perceptual groundtruth data, crosscultural musical similarityalthough mir"

"11 Modeling and annotating complex data structuresAlthough it is possible to associate an unlimited number of arbitrary, complex layers of annotations with a text, an image, or an audio/video file, the most common applications almost always follow the classical approach: additional information associated with primary data is expressed in an ordered hierarchy, using a tree structure as its underlying data model.The present contribution offers a brief review of the more popular ways of data structuring and highlights some of the problems that each of them is meant to handle. The first part of the present chapter focuses on the most relevant issues of data modeling for researchers in the humanities and reviews the basic kinds of the relevant data models. The second part addresses ways to capture these abstract models in concrete encoding formats available to digital humanists. We focus here on approaches that use XML, but the models can also be applied more generally.","video file, relevant, models, common applications"
"An Extensible, Open Framework for Power Quality Disturbance EventsAlthough power quality (PQ) disturbances events such as rms variations and transients occur in transmission and distribution systems, these datasets are mostly managed through proprietary solutions in different data formats. This paper presents a simple, yet effective, metadata database schema to manage voluminous PQ disturbance events in power systems. A database constructed using the schema can be used to store the metadata providing descriptive and analytical analysis of the disturbance events. Proposed schema defines five classes to store the metadata associated with PQ disturbance events: event, time-series, description, software analysis, and IEEE disturbance classification. The classes that form the schema are presented, then are demonstrated using actual disturbance events captured from a distribution system.","metadata database schema, pq disturbance events, rms variations, disturbance events, analysis, power systems, distribution systems"
"Which domains do open‐access journals do best in? A 5‐year longitudinal studyAlthough researchers have begun to investigate the difference in scientific impact between closed‐access and open‐access journals, studies that focus specifically on dynamic and disciplinary differences remain scarce. This study serves to fill this gap by using a large longitudinal dataset to examine these differences. Using CiteScore as a proxy for journal scientific impact, we employ a series of statistical tests to identify the quartile categories and disciplinary areas in which impact trends differ notably between closed‐ and open‐access journals. We find that closed‐access journals have a noticeable advantage in social sciences (for example, business and economics), whereas open‐access journals perform well in medical and healthcare domains (for example, health profession and nursing). Moreover, we find that after controlling for a journals rank and disciplinary differences, there are statistically more closed …","journals, healthcare domains, noticeable advantage, statistical tests, social sciences, longitudinal studyalthough, disciplinary differences, quartile categories"
"Quantitative Evaluation Method for a Literary Structure Hypothesis within the BibleAlthough the literary structures employed in the Bible (chiasmus, concentric structures, and parallelism) are important for its interpretation, the ambiguity of these structures renders them problematic. In this paper, in order to establish an objective framework of evaluation for these structures, a quantitative analysis method is proposed. The target hypothesis of literary structures is the Parallel Literary Structure hypothesis about the hierarchical literary structure of the Bible. This hypothesis proposes that the literary structures in all books of the Bible have a parallel common system. Specifically, the validity of text divisions was evaluated based on divisions rendered in a number of extant Bible translations. Then, corresponding pericope pairs (a pericope is a small story unit in the Bible) that include various “common rare” words and phrases were counted, and the number of valid pairs was compared with the number of randomly constructed structures. From this analysis, statistical significances were extracted and the result strongly supports the hypothesis quantitatively.","quantitative evaluation method, pairs, objective framework, literary structure, concentric structures, parallel common system"
"Amritjit Singh, Nalini Iyer and Rahul K. Gairola, eds. Revisiting India’s Partition: New Essays on Memory, Culture, and PoliticsAlthough the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947 was a cataclysmic event that left millions of people stunned and brutalised, it has taken most historians and literary scholars years to understand the true import of the disruptions that were caused in the lives of ordinary people in South Asia. Because of this, the Partition continues to be written upon, year after year, in creative and critical writings. As recently as October 22, 2017, The Tribune (Chandigarh) carried an exhaustive review of three new books on the Partition. The volume under review is yet another commendable effort at unravelling its complexities. The editors of the volume state in its “Preface” that they put it together because literary scholarship on the subject had “rarely gone beyond a few well known novels, short stories, poems, or films”(ix). In October 2012, they organised a one-day mini-conference in Madison, Wisconsin, to locate the subject’s unexplored aspects, sought out scholars across the globe to write on a wide range of topics, and followed it up by reading and editing the essays to fit its design. All this took three years. The result is a volume of high quality scholarly essays that is varied and comprehensive and quite different from the usual run of edited volumes of essays that are often repetitive and of uneven quality. In their “Introduction,” the editors dwell on how the hasty and arbitrary division of the subcontinent by the British led to the “rupturing of shared histories, cultures, and memories between Muslims, on the one hand, and Hindus and Sikhs, on the other”(xvi). These ruptures were so intense and traumatic that they still haunt “South Asian cultures and lives on a …","indian subcontinent, nalini iyer, amritjit singh, new essays"
"Historians on Hamilton: How a Blockbuster Musical is Restaging Americas PastAmerica has gone Hamilton crazy. Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Tony-winning musical has spawned sold-out performances, a triple platinum cast album, and a score so catchy that it is being used to teach US history in classrooms across the country. But just how historically accurate is Hamilton? And how is the show itself making history? Historians on Hamilton brings together a collection of top scholars to explain the Hamilton phenomenon and explore what it might mean for our understanding of America’s history. The contributors examine what the musical got right, what it got wrong, and why it matters. Does Hamilton’s hip-hop take on the Founding Fathers misrepresent our nation’s past, or does it offer a bold positive vision for our nation’s future? Can a musical so unabashedly contemporary and deliberately anachronistic still communicate historical truths about American culture and politics? And is Hamilton as revolutionary as its creators and many commentators claim? Perfect for students, teachers, theatre fans, hip-hop heads, and history buffs alike, these short and lively essays examine why Hamilton became an Obama-era sensation and consider its continued relevance in the age of Trump. Whether you are a fan or a skeptic, you will come away from this collection with a new appreciation for the meaning and importance of the Hamilton phenomenon.","hiphop, linmanuel miranda, historians, top scholars, restaging america"
"Search for supersymmetry with Higgs boson to diphoton decays using the razor variables at s= 13TeVAn inclusive search for anomalous Higgs boson production in the diphoton decay channel and in association with at least one jet is presented, using LHC proton–proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb− 1. The razor variables M R and R 2, as well as the momentum and mass resolution of the diphoton system, are used to categorize events into different search regions. The search result is interpreted in the context of strong and electroweak production of supersymmetric particles. We exclude bottom squark pair-production with masses below 450 GeV for bottom squarks decaying to a bottom quark, a Higgs boson, and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) for LSP masses below 250 GeV.

Ontologies can be used to structure published data, thereby increasing interoperability. To achieve widespread adoption of ontologies, institutions such as libraries, archives and museums have to be able to assess whether an ontology can adequately capture information about their artifacts. We identify six requirements that should be met by ontologies in the cultural heritage domain, based upon modeling challenges encountered while publishing data of the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam and challenges observed in related work.

"An assessment of multimodal imaging of subsurface text in mummy cartonnage using surrogate papyrus phantomsAncient Egyptian mummies were often covered with an outer casing, panels and masks made from cartonnage: a lightweight material made from linen, plaster, and recycled papyrus held together with adhesive. Egyptologists, papyrologists, and historians aim to recover and read extant text on the papyrus contained within cartonnage layers, but some methods, such as dissolving mummy casings, are destructive. The use of an advanced range of different imaging modalities was investigated to test the feasibility of non-destructive approaches applied to multi-layered papyrus found in ancient Egyptian mummy cartonnage. Eight different techniques were compared by imaging four synthetic phantoms designed to provide robust, well-understood, yet relevant sample standards using modern papyrus and replica inks. The techniques include optical (multispectral imaging with reflection and transillumination, and optical coherence tomography), X-ray (X-ray fluorescence imaging, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, X-ray micro computed tomography and phase contrast X-ray) and terahertz-based approaches. Optical imaging techniques were able to detect inks on all four phantoms, but were unable to significantly penetrate papyrus. X-ray-based techniques were sensitive to iron-based inks with excellent penetration but were not able to detect carbon-based inks. However, using terahertz imaging, it was possible to detect carbon-based inks with good penetration but with less sensitivity to iron-based inks. The phantoms allowed reliable and repeatable tests to be made at multiple sites on three continents.

"Short-term satisfaction and long-term coverage: Understanding how users tolerate algorithmic explorationAny learning algorithm for recommendation faces a fundamental trade-off between exploiting partial knowledge of a user» s interests to maximize satisfaction in the short term and discovering additional user interests to maximize satisfaction in the long term. To enable discovery, a machine learning algorithm typically elicits feedback on items it is uncertain about, which is termed algorithmic exploration in machine learning. This exploration comes with a cost to the user, since the items an algorithm chooses for exploration frequently turn out to not match the user» s interests. In this paper, we study how users tolerate such exploration and how presentation strategies can mitigate the exploration cost. To this end, we conduct a behavioral study with over 600 people, where we vary how algorithmic exploration is mixed into the set of recommendations.

"The formation of Swedish media studies, 1960–1980Around 1960, the politics of the emerging media society in Sweden tended to fixate the formative functions of mass communication. The monopoly of public service broadcast media, press subsidies and new tendencies in film policy were some of the issues around which uncertainty prevailed. New methods to provide reliable data were sought by politicians, since empirical facts were required as arguments for an updated media policy. This article examines the different ways that the field of media studies was introduced in Sweden between 1960 and 1980. We argue that Swedish academic media studies departed from, and emerged within, a rather diffuse borderland between industry, politics and academia. The formation of national media research in Sweden can partly be seen as an effect of politicians and the media industry wanting to be better informed on issues such as media influence, media ownership and …","public service broadcast media, media society, formative functions, formation, policy"

"Art, Media Design, and Postproduction: Open Guidelines on Appropriation and RemixArt, Media Design, and Postproduction: Open Guidelines on Appropriation and Remix offers a set of open-ended guidelines for art and design studio-based projects. The creative application of appropriation and remix are now common across creative disciplines due to the ongoing recycling and repurposing of content and form. Consequently basic elements which were previously exclusive to postproduction for editing image, sound and text, are now part of daily communication. This in turn pushes art and design to reconsider their creative methodologies. Author Eduardo Navas divides his book into three parts: Media Production, Metaproduction, and Postproduction. The chapters that comprise the three parts each include an introduction, goals for guidelines of a studio-based project, which are complemented with an explanation of relevant history, as well as examples and case studies. Each set of guidelines is open-ended, enabling the reader to repurpose the instructional material according to their own methodologies and choice of medium. Navas also provides historical and theoretical context to encourage critical reflection on the effects of remix in the production of art and design. Art, Media Design, and Postproduction: Open Guidelines on Appropriation and Remix is the first book of guidelines to take into account the historical, theoretical, and practical context of remix as an interdisciplinary act. It is an essential read for those interested in remix studies and appropriation in art, design and media.","media design, creative application, open guidelines, art, postproduction, design"
"Gender bias in artificial intelligence: the need for diversity and gender theory in machine learningArtificial intelligence is increasingly influencing the opinions and behavior of people in everyday life. However, the over-representation of men in the design of these technologies could quietly undo decades of advances in gender equality. Over centuries, humans developed critical theory to inform decisions and avoid basing them solely on personal experience. However, machine intelligence learns primarily from observing data that it is presented with. While a machines ability to process large volumes of data may address this in part, if that data is laden with stereotypical concepts of gender, the resulting application of the technology will perpetuate this bias. While some recent studies sought to remove bias from learned algorithms they largely ignore decades of research on how gender ideology is embedded in language.

"What does augmented reality mean as a medium of expression for computational artists?As augmented reality (AR) quickly evolves with new technological practice, there is a growing need to question and re-evaluate its potential as a medium for creative expression. The authors discuss AR within computational art, framed within AR as a medium, AR aesthetics and applications. The Augmented Reality Immersive Instruments (ARImI), a two-day forum on AR, highlights both possibilities and fundamental concerns for continuing artworks in this field including visual bias, sensory modalities, interactivity, and performativity. The authors offer a new AR definition as real-time computationally mediated perception.","twoday forum, computational"
"The doctoral dissertation and scholarly communication: Adapting to changing publication practices among graduate studentsAs graduate students begin to publish earlier in their careers, the relationship between the doctoral dissertation and scholarly publishing is evolving. Many students now include their own previously published work in a dissertation, requiring instruction in publication contracts and copyright transfer agreements at the point of submission to the graduate school. There are repercussions to publishing as a graduate student for which our institutions are not well prepared, and to which librarian could apply our expertise. This article briefly reviews the history of dissertation publishing and introduces issues surrounding the use of previously published materials in doctoral dissertations.","doctoral dissertation, scholarly communication, graduate studentsas graduate students, graduate school, publication practices, publication contracts"
"""Places We Actually Go"": three Irish poets debutsAs readers of poetry, we consistently commit the same act of self-deprivation – we associate literary quality with longevity. This emerges from a sort of reverse ageism, wherein the pillars of national canons are often authors who have remained prolific across several decades, the assumption being that great poets return to the anvil. Coupled with longevity is visibility, the extent to which a poet is seen to be successful. While the canonizing influence of visibility has always been present, it has been reinforced in an age of social media-enabled posturing. To be a great writer, then, it would seem one must be both productive and visible – a trend that suggests that we have forgotten how to listen when words might vouch for themselves, how to recognize literary greatness when it creeps up on us, quiet and unassuming. In Elaine Cosgrove, Roisin Kelly, and Annemarie Ní Churreáin whose debut collections were released over the past 24 months – we find Ireland’s strongest contemporary voices. Not the strongest young voices, not the strongest potential voices – the strongest voices.","debutsas readers, irish poets, national canons, strongest contemporary voices, reverse ageism"
"Examining a hate speech corpus for hate speech detection and popularity predictionAs research on hate speech becomes more and more relevant every day, most of it is still focused on hate speech detection. By attempting to replicate a hate speech detection experiment performed on an existing Twitter corpus annotated for hate speech, we highlight some issues that arise from doing research in the field of hate speech, which is essentially still in its infancy. We take a critical look at the training corpus in order to understand its biases, while also using it to venture beyond hate speech detection and investigate whether it can be used to shed light on other facets of research, such as popularity of hate tweets.","research, hate speech, training corpus, popularity, popularity predictionas research, twitter corpus, hate tweets"
"Machine Decisions and Human ConsequencesAs we increasingly delegate decision-making to algorithms, whether directly or indirectly, important questions emerge in circumstances where those decisions have direct consequences for individual rights and personal opportunities, as well as for the collective good. A key problem for policymakers is that the social implications of these new methods can only be grasped if there is an adequate comprehension of their general technical underpinnings. The discussion here focuses primarily on the case of enforcement decisions in the criminal justice system, but draws on similar situations emerging from other algorithms utilised in controlling access to opportunities, to explain how machine learning works and, as a result, how decisions are made by modern intelligent algorithms orclassifiers. It examines the key aspects of the performance of classifiers, including how classifiers learn, the fact that they operate on the basis of correlation rather than causation, and that the termbias in machine learning has a different meaning to common usage. An example of a real worldclassifier, the Harm Assessment Risk Tool (HART), is examined, through identification of its technical features: the classification method, the training data and the test data, the features and the labels, validation and performance measures. Four normative benchmarks are then considered by reference to HART:(a) prediction accuracy (b) fairness and equality before the law (c) transparency and accountability (d) informational privacy and freedom of expression, in order to demonstrate how its technical features have important normative dimensions that bear directly on the extent to …","individual rights, decisions, collective good, human consequencesas, machine decisions, direct consequences"
"Searching for Dr. Johnson: The Digitisation of the Burney Newspaper CollectionAs you enter the Rare Books and Music Reading Room of the British Library, the bookshelves on your left-hand side are full of boxes of microfilm which few readers ever touch. These are the microfilms of the Burney Collection of newspapers which twenty five years ago were one of the most frequently used microfilm sets in the British Library. The microfilms are no longer much used because of the release in late 2007 by Gale Cengage Learning in partnership with the British Library of a searchable database of the Burney Newspapers which provides more convenient access to the collection both in the British Library and remotely. The boxes of microfilms of Burney Newspapers in the Rare Books Reading Room now seem like fossils, discarded relics of a superannuated information technology–the British Library collection guide to newspapers only refers to the digital version and does not mention the existence of the microfilms. 1 Yet our use of the digital resource is still profoundly shaped by the technology and limitations of the microfilm set, and whenever you enter the Rare Books Reading Room it is worth glancing at the microfilm as a reminder of the pitfalls inherent in using the digitised Burney Newspapers. The Burney Collection is the largest single collection of early English newspapers, currently containing nearly a million pages in about 1,290 titles, and it was purchased by the British Museum in 1818 from the estate of Rev. Charles Burney (1757–1817), the son of the music historian Dr. Charles Burney and brother of the novelist Frances Burney.

"Giordano Bruno and Bonaventura Cavalieris theories of indivisibles: a case of shared knowledgeAt the turn of the seventeenth century, Bruno and Cavalieri independently developed two theories, central to which was the concept of the geometrical indivisible. The introduction of indivisibles had significant implications for geometry – especially in the case of Cavalieri, for whom indivisibles provided a forerunner of the calculus. But how did this event occur? What can we learn from the fact that two theories of indivisibles arose at about the same time? These are the questions addressed in this paper. Relying on the methodology of “historical epistemology”, this paper asserts that the similarities and differences between the theories of Bruno and Cavalieri can be explained in terms of “shared knowledge”. The paper shows that the idea – on which both Bruno and Cavalieri build – that geometrical objects are generated by motion was part of the mathematical culture of the time. Tracing this idea back to its …","giordano bruno, significant implications, seventeenth century, theories, bonaventura cavalieri, geometrical indivisible"
"Designing Augmented Reality Applications for Personal Health Decision-MakingAugmented reality (AR) is a technology that can assist with our daily decision-making tasks by presenting information that extends the physical world. However, little work has been done to understand the effect of the layout of AR interfaces on decision-making. In this paper, we present PHARA, an AR-based personal assistant that supports decision-making for healthier food products. In a controlled user study (n=28), we explored the use of four different AR layouts on two different devices: Microsoft HoloLens and smartphone. Using subjective and objective means, we measured their effects on decision-making tasks that occur when people hold food products in their hands. We found that pie and grid layouts perform better on the smartphone, whereas a stacked layout works better on the reduced field-of-view of the Microsoft HoloLens, potentially at the cost of some affordances such as time spent and actions.","layouts, personal health, ar interfaces, healthier food products, designing augmented reality applications"
"Understanding the dynamics between the United States and Australian film markets: testing the ‘10% rule’Australia has historically been an important market for American media exports. As far as film trade relations between the two countries go, there is an anecdotal perception that distributors follow a ‘10% rule’ to predict the popularity of Hollywood titles in Australia, expecting American films to earn around one-tenth of their domestic box office receipts when screened downunder. Nonetheless, as prevalent as this ‘rule’ has been in the industry, it has not been seriously tested. This article addresses the gap in both scholarship and business practices and uses the ‘10% rule’ as a starting point to discuss various facets of the relationship between the two markets. We measure the popularity of American films among Australian audiences as well as contrast the differences that emerge in terms of distribution and exhibition in these markets.

"Preserving Author Editing History Using Blockchain TechnologyAuthorship contribution is often taken for granted. Internally, the contribution rate is usually known among all the authors of a given paper. However, this rate is hard to be verified by external parties, as the measurement of the authors contribution is still not common and the way to measure it is unclear. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain based framework to assess the contribution of all authors of any scientific paper. Our framework can be implemented by anyone who is directly or indirectly involved in the publication of the paper, such as a principal researcher, grant funder, research assistant or anyone from relevant external bodies.","relevant external bodies, framework, rate, external parties, blockchain technologyauthorship contribution"
"Peer to peer: Using a discussion group to introduce staff and faculty to emerging technologiesAwareness of new and emerging technologies is vital to the continuing education of library staff and faculty in settings ranging from public libraries to national research libraries. However, the complex nature of new technologies and limitations of prior tech literacy can prove to be a stumbling block for even highly motivated library workers. While the challenges of investigating new technologies may seem insurmountable, the implementation of group-oriented knowledge sharing methodologies can greatly reduce barriers to learning while also creating a constructivist setting in which library workers can learn together.  At the University of Maryland Libraries, a staff- and faculty-led discussion group has taken on this challenge by administering monthly sessions where staff, faculty, and students are welcome to join conversations about new and emerging trends in technologies and libraries. By hosting staff specialists and volunteer speakers, sessions present difficult technology topics in a comfortable, open format. Furthermore, tool demonstrations allow attendees to discovery new applications and platforms that may have meaningful impacts on their day-to-day work.  This poster presents a brief history of the Emerging Technologies Discussion Group, highlighting the variety of topics presented over the seven years of its existence. Additionally, this poster presents the benefits of such a low-stress, low-barrier group format. Lastly, the poster provides useful tips for those interested in starting a similar group, including topics such as important administrative considerations and suggested formats for discussion- and tool-oriented events.","libraries, staff, discussion group, new technologies, library staff"
"Environmental purchasing: A framework for theory developmentB&NE research has established more than a 20-year foundation of scholarly output, with trajectories showing an upward trend until the late 2000s (see ) followed by a plateau (see –). As we look to the future, we can expect continued work within both the mainstream literature and the specialty journals, and on both existing research streams as well as new and contradictory streams. This duality of being both on the “inside” and on the “outside” is critical to the growth and vitality of the field. It represents a healthy tension of focusing on environmental issues within the existing models, theories and paradigms of “normal science”  to contribute to the field while also stepping outside the domains of existing theory to fully capture the magnitude and scope of the problem we face by pushing “the literature to ask the ‘big’ questions and push beyond the existing paradigm” (: 21) that are built on a model of “revolutionary” science .","environmental purchasing, research, mainstream literature, normal science, framework, theory, scholarly output, upward trend, specialty journals, streams"
"Early low-anticoagulant desulfated heparin after traumatic brain injury: Reduced brain edema and leukocyte mobilization is associated with improved watermaze learning ability …BACKGROUND Unfractionated heparin administered immediately after traumatic brain injury (TBI) reduces brain leukocyte (LEU) accumulation, and enhances early cognitive recovery, but may increase bleeding after injury. It is unknown how non-anticoagulant heparins, such as 2, 3-O desulfated heparin (ODSH), impact post-TBI cerebral inflammation and long-term recovery. We hypothesized that ODSH after TBI reduces LEU-mediated brain inflammation and improves long-term neurologic recovery.METHODS CD1 male mice (n= 66) underwent either TBI (controlled cortical impact CCI) or sham craniotomy. 2, 3-O desulfated heparin (25 mg/kg 25ODSH or 50 mg/kg 50ODSH) or saline was administered for 48 hours after TBI in 46 animals.

"Image-based remapping of spatially-varying material appearanceBRDF models are ubiquitous tools for the representation of material appearance. However, there is now an astonishingly large number of different models in practical use. Both a lack of BRDF model standardisation across implementations found in different renderers, as well as the often semantically different capabilities of various models, have grown to be a major hindrance to the interchange of production assets between different rendering systems. Current attempts to solve this problem rely on manually finding visual similarities between models, or mathematical ones between their functional shapes, which requires access to the shader implementation, usually unavailable in commercial renderers. We present a method for automatic translation of material appearance between different BRDF models, which uses an image-based metric for appearance comparison, and that delegates the interaction with the model to the renderer. We analyse the performance of the method, both with respect to robustness and visual differences of the fits for multiple combinations of BRDF models. While it is effective for individual BRDFs, the computational cost does not scale well for spatially-varying BRDFs. Therefore, we further present a parametric regression scheme that approximates the shape of the transformation function and generates a reduced representation which evaluates instantly and without further interaction with the renderer. We present respective visual comparisons of the remapped SVBRDF models for commonly used renderers and shading models, and show that our approach is able to extrapolate transformed BRDF parameters better than …","ubiquitous tools, material appearance, brdf model standardisation, brdfs, brdf models"
"Weather and risk of ST-elevation myocardial infarction revisited: Impact on young womenBackground During the last decade, the incidence and mortality rates of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been steadily increasing in young women but not in men. Environmental variables that contribute to cardiovascular events in women remain ill-defined.   Methods and results A total of 2199 consecutive patients presenting with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, 25.8% women, mean age 62.6±12.4 years) were admitted at the Montreal Heart Institute between June 2010 and December 2014. Snow fall exceeding 2cm/day was identified as a positive predictor for STEMI admission rates in the overall population (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07–1.48, p = 0.005), with a significant effect being seen in men (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06–1.53, p = 0.01) but not in women (p = NS). An age-specific analysis revealed a significant increase in hospital admission rates for STEMI in younger women ≤55 years, (n = 104) during days with higher outside temperature (p = 0.004 vs men ≤55 years) and longer daylight hours (p = 0.0009 vs men ≤55 years). Accordingly, summer season, increased outside temperature and sunshine hours were identified as strong positive predictors for STEMI occurrence in women ≤55 years (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.1–2.5, p = 0.012, RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.2–2.5, p = 0.007, and RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.2–2.5, p = 0.011, respectively), while an opposite trend was observed in men ≤55 years (RR for outside temperature 0.8, 95% CI 0.73–0.95, p = 0.01).

"Gait rehabilitation by outdoor rhythmic haptic cueing using wearable technology for neurological conditions: a case studyBackground For people with neurological conditions such as stroke and brain injury, gait rehabilitation can lead to a significantly more independent lifestyle. Existing gait rehabilitation studies with stroke survivors using rhythmic haptic cueing via wearable devices have demonstrated improvements in temporal symmetry, increase in stride length and walking speed. However, these studies have been limited to laboratory settings and focused on short-term improvements only. By contrast, we present results from the first longitudinal case study on the self-managed use of wearable haptic devices for gait rehabilitation via entrainment in outdoor settings.  Methods A longitudinal pilot study was conducted with a brain injury survivor, providing rhythmic haptic cueing using a wearable haptic device for a two-week period. The participant was asked to walk in synchrony to the haptic rhythm at a suitable outdoor setting for a minimum of 10 minutes each day. Gait data was measured before and after the two-week intervention using lab-based IMU sensors.   Results On comparing the before and after gait characteristics, preliminary results showed improvement in temporal symmetry, walking speed and stride length.   Conclusions Implications for long-term benefits in gait rehabilitation using rhythmic haptic cueing for various neurological conditions are considered. Improvements in temporal symmetry, increase in stride length and walking speed could improve confidence, independence and overall quality of life for patients, with implications for reduction of costs associated with care and rehabilitation.","neurological conditions, rhythmic haptic cueing, wearable haptic devices, gait rehabilitation, outdoor rhythmic haptic cueing"
"Overexpression of the Pluripotent Stem Cell Marker Podocalyxin in Prostate CancerBackground/Aim: Podocalyxin, a member of the CD34 family of cell surface sialomucins, is overexpressed in human embryonal carcinoma cell lines, as well as in several cancer types, and is associated with poor prognosis. Podocalyxin variants are associated with an increased risk and aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Herein podocalyxin protein expression in prostate cancer was characterized. Materials and Methods: Expression of podocalyxin as well as of TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-81 antigens was assessed immunohistochemically in 84 radical prostatectomy specimens and in adjacent normal tissues. Results: Podocalyxin expression and H-scores were considerably higher in prostate tumors compared to normal tissues. High TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-81 staining was detected, however, in a much smaller percentage of prostate tumors, while their expression and H-scores were low in normal tissues.

"Discipline-specific open access publishing practices and barriers to change: an evidence-based reviewBackground: Many of the discussions surrounding Open Access (OA) revolve around how it affects publishing practices across different academic disciplines. It was a long-held view that it would be only a matter of time for all disciplines to fully and relatively homogeneously implement OA. Recent large-scale bibliometric studies show however that the uptake of OA differs substantially across disciplines. This study investigates the underlying mechanisms that cause disciplines to vary in their OA publishing practices. We aimed to answer two questions: First, how do different disciplines adopt and shape OA publishing practices? Second, what discipline-specific barriers to and potentials for OA can be identified?   Methods: In a first step, we identified and synthesized relevant bibliometric studies that assessed OA prevalence and publishing patterns across disciplines. In a second step, and adopting a social shaping of technology perspective, we studied evidence on the socio-technical forces that shape OA publishing practices. We examined a variety of data sources, including, but not limited to, publisher policies and guidelines, OA mandates and policies and author surveys.   Results: Over the last three decades, scholarly publishing has experienced a shift from “closed” access to OA as the proportion of scholarly literature that is openly accessible has increased continuously. The shift towards OA is however uneven across disciplines in two respects: first, the growth of OA has been uneven across disciplines, which manifests itself in varying OA prevalence levels. Second, disciplines use different OA publishing channels to make research outputs OA …","evidencebased reviewbackground, disciplinespecific, open access, oa prevalence, oa publishing, barriers, publishing practices, access"

"Characterizing Websites That Provide Information About Complementary and Integrative Health: Systematic Search and Evaluation of Five Domains.BackgroundIn recent years, there has been an increase in the utilization of complementary and integrative health (CIH) care, and an increase in information-seeking behavior focused on CIH. Thus, understanding the quality of CIH information that is available on the internet is imperative. Although there have been a limited number of studies evaluating the quality of websites providing information about specific CIH-related topics, a broad evaluation of CIH websites has not been conducted.ObjectiveThis study was designed to fill that gap.

"Understanding Privacy Dichotomy in TwitterBalancing personalization and privacy is one of the challenges marketers commonly face. The privacy dilemmas associated with personalized services are particularly concerning in the context of social networking websites, wherein the privacy dichotomy problem is widely observed. To prevent potential privacy violations, businesses need to employ multiple safeguards beyond the current privacy settings of users. As a possible solution, companies can utilize user social footprints to detect user privacy preferences. To take a step towards this goal, we first ran a series of experiments to examine if the privacy preference attribute is homophilous in social media. As a result, we found a set of clues that users privacy preferences are similar to the privacy behaviour of their social contacts, signaling that privacy homophily exists in social networks. We further studied users located in different neighbourhoods with varying …","social networking websites, privacy dichotomy, twitterbalancing personalization"
"Barcode: Bayesian reconstruction of cosmic density fieldsBarcode (BAyesian Reconstruction of COsmic DEnsity fields) samples the primordial density fields compatible with a set of dark matter density tracers after cosmic evolution observed in redshift space. It uses a redshift space model based on the analytic solution of coherent flows within a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo posterior sampling of the primordial density field; this method is applicable to analytically derivable structure formation models, such as the Zeldovich approximation, but also higher order schemes such as augmented Lagrangian perturbation theory or even particle mesh models. The algorithm is well-suited for analysis of the dark matter cosmic web implied by the observed spatial distribution of galaxy clusters, such as obtained from X-ray, SZ or weak lensing surveys, as well as that of the intergalactic medium sampled by the Lyman alpha forest. In these cases, virialized motions are negligible and the …","cosmic density, barcode, bayesian reconstruction, cosmic evolution, redshift space, dark matter density tracers"

"Creating a Community-Driven Digital Archive: The Harvey Memories ProjectBetween August 17 and 30, 2017, Tropical Storm Harvey -- later Hurricane Harvey -- crisscrossed the Southeast corner of Texas, killing 88 Texans, damaging or destroying more than 119,000 homes in Harris County, and causing as much as $190 billion dollars in damage. Behind these numbers are thousands of stories of loss, trauma, recovery, and resilience.  Soon after the flooding, a dialogue developed between Rice University, the University of Houston Libraries, Harris County Public Libraries, and Houston Public Libraries about how we might build a digital archive that enables people to share their stories about Harvey.  Funded through a Rice University Houston Engagement and Recovery Effort (HERE) grant, the Harvey Memories Project (HMP) aims to to collect personal narratives, photos, audio, and video about the experience of Harvey in a digital archive. Its core values include a focus on the community, diversity, compassion, and sustainability. Developing such a digital archive raises complex questions: How do we make the archive useful both to people who experienced Harvey and to researchers who want to study their experiences? How can we respect contributors’ privacy while inviting them to share openly? How do we design the archive to make it easy for HMP contributors from diverse backgrounds to submit materials to the collection, while also making it easy for all users to find objects in the archive?

In this chapter, we present two specific tasks related to life language processing: (1) Developing language-model based representations for biological sequences: the large gap between the number of known sequences (raw data) versus the number of known functions/structures associated with these sequences (metadata), encourages us to develop methods that can obtain prior knowledge from the existing sequences to be used in bioinformatics tasks (e.g., protein …","deep genomics, biochemical principles, life language processing, proteomics, methods, language modelbased embedding, specific tasks, biological sequences"

"Mapping the Bentham Corpus: Concept-based NavigationBritish philosopher and reformer Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) left over 60,000 folios of unpublished manuscripts. The Bentham Project, at University College London, is creating a TEI version of the manuscripts, via crowdsourced transcription verified by experts. We present here an interface to navigate these largely unedited manuscripts, and the language technologies the corpus was enriched with to facilitate navigation, i.e Entity Linking against the DBpedia knowledge base and keyphrase extraction. The challenges of tagging a historical domain-specific corpus with a contemporary knowledge base are discussed. The concepts extracted were used to create interactive co-occurrence networks, that serve as a map for the corpus and help navigate it, along with a search index. These corpus representations were integrated in a user interface. The interface was evaluated by domain experts with satisfactory results , e.g. they found the distributional semantics methods exploited here applicable in order to assist in retrieving related passages for scholarly editing of the corpus.","bentham project, reformer jeremy bentham, unpublished manuscripts, bentham corpus, tei version, language technologies, dbpedia knowledge base, navigationbritish philosopher, interface, university college london, experts"

But even in light of breakthrough results on recent benchmarks, it is still fair to ask if our recognition algorithms are doing as well as we think they are. The vision sciences at large make use of a very different evaluation regime known as Visual Psychophysics to study visual perception. Psychophysics is the quantitative examination of the relationships between controlled stimuli and the behavioral responses they elicit in experimental test subjects. Instead of using summary statistics to gauge performance, psychophysics directs us to construct item-response curves made up of individual stimulus responses to find perceptual thresholds, thus allowing one to identify the exact point at which a subject can no longer reliably recognize the stimulus …","psychophysics, evaluation framework, experimental test subjects, psyphy, computer vision, standardized evaluation protocols, individual stimulus responses, recognition"

"Effects of chronic caffeine exposure during adolescence and subsequent acute caffeine challenge during adulthood on rat brain serotonergic systemsCaffeine is the most commonly used drug in the world. However, animal studies suggest that chronic consumption of caffeine during adolescence can result in enhanced anxiety-like behavioral responses during adulthood. One mechanism through which chronic caffeine administration may influence subsequent anxiety-like responses is through actions on brainstem serotonergic systems. In order to explore potential effects of chronic caffeine consumption on brainstem serotonergic systems, we evaluated the effects of a 28-day exposure to chronic caffeine (0.3 g/L; postnatal day 28–56) or vehicle administration in the drinking water, followed by 24 h caffeine withdrawal, and subsequent challenge with caffeine (30 mg/kg; s.c.) or vehicle in adolescent male rats.

"Friending the Past: The Sense of History in the Digital AgeCan today’s society, increasingly captivated by a constant flow of information, share a sense of history? How did our media-making forebears balance the tension between the present and the absent, the individual and the collective, the static and the dynamic—and how do our current digital networks disrupt these same balances? Can our social media, with its fleeting nature, even be considered social at all? In Friending the Past, Alan Liu proposes fresh answers to these innovative questions of connection. He explores how we can learn from the relationship between past societies whose media forms fostered a communal and self-aware sense of history—such as prehistorical oral societies with robust storytelling cultures, or the great print works of nineteenth-century historicism—and our own instantaneous present. He concludes with a surprising look at how the sense of history exemplified in today’s JavaScript timelines compares to the temporality found in Romantic poetry. Interlaced among these inquiries, Liu shows how extensive “network archaeologies” can be constructed as novel ways of thinking about our affiliations with time and with each other. These conceptual architectures of period and age are also always media structures, scaffolded with the outlines of what we mean by history. Thinking about our own time, Liu wonders if the digital, networked future can sustain a similar sense of history.","selfaware sense, digital, constant flow, media, societies, alan liu"

"Spatial constraints on the diffusion of religious innovations: The case of early Christianity in the Roman EmpireChristianity emerged as a small and marginal movement in the first century Palestine and throughout the following three centuries it became highly visible in the whole Mediterranean. Little is known about the mechanisms of spreading innovative ideas in past societies. Here we investigate how well the spread of Christianity can be explained as a diffusive process constrained by physical travel in the Roman Empire. First, we combine a previously established model of the transportation network with city population estimates and evaluate to which extent the spatio-temporal pattern of the spread of Christianity can be explained by static factors. Second, we apply a network-theoretical approach to analyze the spreading process utilizing effective distance. We show that the spread of Christianity in the first two centuries closely follows a gravity-guided diffusion, and is substantially accelerated in the third century. Using the effective distance measure, we are able to suggest the probable path of the spread. Our work demonstrates how the spatio-temporal patterns we observe in the data can be explained using only spatial constraints and urbanization structure of the empire. Our findings also provide a methodological framework to be reused for studying other cultural spreading phenomena.","religious innovations, innovative ideas, spatial constraints, distance, marginal movement, early christianity, century, roman empirechristianity"
"A multilayer exploration of the cognitive structure of publications in historyCitation networks among journal articles are perhaps the most common object of investigation in bibliometrics. For example, citation networks are widely used for science mapping as a way to explore the cognitive structure of scientific fields. Within this framework, the disciplines traditionally part of the humanities fare differently. Their main trait being the interplay of a broader array of publication typologies – monographs, edited volumes, journal articles – with a richer set of cited objects, including primary evidence. Consequently, when considered from a science mapping perspective, a community, field or specialism in the humanities might be represented as a multilayer network. We consider here a specialism in history, the history of Venice, and represent it using a set of publications including both books (edited and monographs) and journal articles. This set of publications is interconnected using three similarity measures: bibliographic coupling over references to books, bibliographic coupling over references to primary sources and textual similarity. The result is a multi-relation network with three distinct dimensions (that we will call layers), one per similarity measure, connecting the same publications. Given this representation, we proceed to analyse the different communities emerging from the three layers, to qualify them and consider to what extent they overlap or instead provide for orthogonal conceptual spaces.","multilayer exploration, common object, similarity, science mapping, networks, cognitive structure, journal articles, richer set"

"Accuracy of pathline predicates for flow visualization at the example of the benguela upwelling systemCoastal upwelling systems transport nutrient-rich water to the upper layer of the ocean. These regions are especially important for marine life and fishery. We are using pathline predicates to create visualizations of the spatio-temporal structure of the Benguela upwelling system. Based on a 3D flow field of a regional ocean model, we first derive space-filling trajectories covering the full model grid. With pathline predicates, we select trajectories related to upwelling. Next, we derive a 3D scalar field representing the pathline density, which is visualized using volume rendering techniques. Further analyses of the pathlines show a distinct annual cycle in the upwelling activity, which fits well to observation-based analyses found in literature. These techniques and their application are described in 1. In this work, we focus on evaluating the accuracy of our techniques.

Musicians and nonmusicians heard cadential excerpts selected from Mozart’s keyboard sonatas (perfect authentic cadence PAC, imperfect authentic cadence IAC, half cadence HC, deceptive cadence DC, and evaded cadence EV), and continuously rated the strength of their expectations that the end of each excerpt is imminent.

"Using arborescences to estimate hierarchicalness in directed complex networksComplex networks are a useful tool for the understanding of complex systems. One of the emerging properties of such systems is their tendency to form hierarchies: networks can be organized in levels, with nodes in each level exerting control on the ones beneath them. In this paper, we focus on the problem of estimating how hierarchical a directed network is. We propose a structural argument: a network has a strong top-down organization if we need to delete only few edges to reduce it to a perfect hierarchy—an arborescence. In an arborescence, all edges point away from the root and there are no horizontal connections, both characteristics we desire in our idealization of what a perfect hierarchy requires. We test our arborescence score in synthetic and real-world directed networks against the current state of the art in hierarchy detection: agony, flow hierarchy and global reaching centrality. These tests highlight that our arborescence score is intuitive and we can visualize it; it is able to better distinguish between networks with and without a hierarchical structure; it agrees the most with the literature about the hierarchy of well-studied complex systems; and it is not just a score, but it provides an overall scheme of the underlying hierarchy of any directed complex network.","perfect hierarchy, complex systems, arborescence, complex networkscomplex networks, strong topdown organization"
"Perinatal Human Remains from Poggio Civitate (Murlo): A Preliminary PresentationComprehensive analysis of faunal remains from the Etruscan settlement of Poggio Civitate was initiated in 2011. During the analysis of zoological materials collected in past and ongoing excavations, several human skeletal specimens were identified. Stratigraphically these bones are tied to the site’s Orientalizing period of architectural development. Analysis of the human assemblage, which to date includes 47 specimens, shows that the bones represent perinates who died around the time of birth. Furthermore, none of the remains come from archaeological contexts reflective of formal, ritualized disposition. Instead, the bones all derive from large deposits of animal and cultural debris, and most come from refuse deposits that are concentrated around areas of non-elite domestic and industrial activities.

"Large-Scale Object Detection of Images from Network Cameras in Variable Ambient Lighting ConditionsComputer vision relies on labeled datasets for training and evaluation in detecting and recognizing objects. The popular computer vision program, YOLO ("" You Only Look Once""), has been shown to accurately detect objects in many major image datasets. However, the images found in those datasets, are independent of one another and cannot be used to test YOLOs consistency at detecting the same object as its environment (eg ambient lighting) changes. This paper describes a novel effort to evaluate YOLOs consistency for large-scale applications. It does so by working (a) at large scale and (b) by using consecutive images from a curated network of public video cameras deployed in a variety of real-world situations, including traffic intersections, national parks, shopping malls, university campuses, etc. We specifically examine YOLOs ability to detect objects in different scenarios (eg, daytime vs. night), leveraging the cameras ability to rapidly retrieve many successive images for evaluating detection consistency. Using our camera network and advanced computing resources (supercomputers), we analyzed more than 5 million images captured by 140 network cameras in 24 hours. Compared with labels marked by humans (considered as"" ground truth""), YOLO struggles to consistently detect the same humans and cars as their positions change from one frame to the next; it also struggles to detect objects at night time. Our findings suggest that state-of-the art vision solutions should be trained by data from network camera with contextual information before they can be deployed in applications that demand high consistency on object detection.","ambient lighting, network cameras, object detection, popular computer vision program, consistency"
"Conceptual Analysis in a computer-assisted framework: mind in PeirceConceptual Analysis (CA) is a matter-of-course practice for philosophers and other scholars in the humanities. Exploring one author’s corpus of texts in order to discover the various properties of a concept is a classic example of CA. Recently, a corpus-based computational framework for CA has been emerging in response to the methodological challenges brought about by the massive digitization of texts. In this framework, CA is approached by implementing a computer-assisted text analysis method, within which algorithms are used to support the various cognitive operations involved in CA. In this article, we focus on the retrieval of relevant text segments for analysis. However, this is a complex issue within a computational framework, since the relation between concept and natural language depends on several semantic phenomena, including synonymy, polysemy, and contextual modulation. The main contribution of this article is methodological because it explores the computational approach to CA. We present three algorithmic methods, which identify relevant text segments while taking into account various semantic phenomena. The results show the potential of computer-assisted CA, thereby highlighting the need to overcome the limitations of these first experiments. An additional contribution of this work takes the form of knowledge transfer from Artificial Intelligence to the Humanities.","computational framework, matterofcourse practice, framework, contribution, peirceconceptual analysis, computerassisted framework, conceptual analysis"

"Face Hallucination Revisited: An Exploratory Study on Dataset BiasContemporary face hallucination (FH) models exhibit considerable ability to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) details from low-resolution (LR) face images. This ability is commonly learned from examples of corresponding HR-LR image pairs, created by artificially down-sampling the HR ground truth data. This down-sampling (or degradation) procedure not only defines the characteristics of the LR training data, but also determines the type of image degradations the learned FH models are eventually able to handle. If the image characteristics encountered with real-world LR images differ from the ones seen during training, FH models are still expected to perform well, but in practice may not produce the desired results. In this paper we study this problem and explore the bias introduced into FH models by the characteristics of the training data. We systematically analyze the generalization capabilities of several FH models in various scenarios, where the image the degradation function does not match the training setup and conduct experiments with synthetically downgraded as well as real-life low-quality images. We make several interesting findings that provide insight into existing problems with FH models and point to future research directions.Subjects: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.

"Programming touch and full-body interaction with a remotely controlled robot in a secondary education STEM courseContemporary research has introduced educational robotics in the classroom, but there are few studies about the effects of alternative embodied interaction modalities on computational thinking and science education. Twenty-six middle school students were asked to program interfaces for controlling the heading and speed of a robot using two types of embodied interaction modalities. We compared touch and full-body gestures to autonomous control, which does not require any embodied interaction. We assessed the development of their computational thinking skills by analyzing the projects they created during a problem-solving task and examined their understandings of science concepts related to kinematics. We found that novice students preferred full-body interfaces, while advanced students moved to more disembodied and abstract computational thinking. These findings might be applied to focus computing …","educational robotics, fullbody interaction, coursecontemporary research, secondary education, programming touch, science education, computational thinking, embodied interaction, students"

"Computing controversy: Formal model and algorithms for detecting controversy on Wikipedia and in search queriesControversy is a complex concept that has been attracting attention of scholars from diverse fields. In the era of Internet and social media, detecting controversy and controversial concepts by the means of automatic methods is especially important. Web searchers could be alerted when the contents they consume are controversial or when they attempt to acquire information on disputed topics. Presenting users with the indications and explanations of the controversy should offer them chance to see the “wider picture” rather than letting them obtain one-sided views. In this work we first introduce a formal model of controversy as the basis of computational approaches to detecting controversial concepts. Then we propose a classification based method for automatic detection of controversial articles and categories in Wikipedia. Next, we demonstrate how to use the obtained results for the estimation of the controversy …","automatic methods, social media, search queriescontroversy, formal model, controversy, controversial concepts, web searchers, algorithms, wikipedia"

"Learning on the Edge: Explicit Boundary Handling in CNNsConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) handle the case where filters extend beyond the image boundary using several heuristics, such as zero, repeat or mean padding. These schemes are applied in an ad-hoc fashion and, being weakly related to the image content and oblivious of the target task, result in low output quality at the boundary. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective improvement that learns the boundary handling itself. At training-time, the network is provided with a separate set of explicit boundary filters. At testing-time, we use these filters which have learned to extrapolate features at the boundary in an optimal way for the specific task. Our extensive evaluation, over a wide range of architectural changes (variations of layers, feature channels, or both), shows how the explicit filters result in improved boundary handling. Consequently, we demonstrate an improvement of 5% to 20% across the board of typical CNN applications (colorization, de-Bayering, optical flow, and disparity estimation).Subjects: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.

"Has Resistance Taken Root in US Corn Fields? Demand for Insect ControlCorn farmers reported unexpectedly severe damage on fields planted with genetically-engineered rootworm-resistant (Bt-CRW) corn seeds during the 2009 growing season. Entomologists later determined that rootworms on these fields had developed resistance to the insecticidal proteins produced by Bt-CRW corn. This article explores what corn farmers’ seed and soil insecticide choices imply about rootworm resistance in the United States. First, a soil insecticide demand function is derived using a damage-abatement model. Next, this demand function is estimated using field-level data from 2005 and 2010. We find that rootworms (Diabrotica spp.) cost farmers approximately $1.3 billion in 2005 and $2 billion in 2010. When used, Bt-CRW seeds were very effective, reducing average yield losses by approximately five bushels per acre and providing over twice as much control (on average) as soil insecticides.

"Is it worth it? Budget-related evaluation metrics for model selectionCreating a linguistic resource is often done by using a machine learning model that filters the content that goes through to a human annotator, before going into the final resource. However, budgets are often limited, and the amount of available data exceeds the amount of affordable annotation. In order to optimize the benefit from the invested human work, we argue that deciding on which model one should employ depends not only on generalized evaluation metrics such as F-score, but also on the gain metric. Because the model with the highest F-score may not necessarily have the best sequencing of predicted classes, this may lead to wasting funds on annotating false positives, yielding zero improvement of the linguistic resource. We exemplify our point with a case study, using real data from a task of building a verb-noun idiom dictionary. We show that, given the choice of three systems with varying F-scores, the system with the highest F-score does not yield the highest profits. In other words, in our case the cost-benefit trade off is more favorable for a system with a lower F-score.","model, highest fscore, real data, human annotator, evaluation metrics, linguistic resource"
"Beyond pixels: Image provenance analysis leveraging metadataCreative works, whether paintings or memes, follow unique journeys that result in their final form. Understanding these journeys, a process known as"" provenance analysis"", provides rich insights into the use, motivation, and authenticity underlying any given work. The application of this type of study to the expanse of unregulated content on the Internet is what we consider in this paper. Provenance analysis provides a snapshot of the chronology and validity of content as it is uploaded, re-uploaded, and modified over time. Although still in its infancy, automated provenance analysis for online multimedia is already being applied to different types of content. Most current works seek to build provenance graphs based on the shared content between images or videos. This can be a computationally expensive task, especially when considering the vast influx of content that the Internet sees every day. Utilizing non-content-based information, such as timestamps, geotags, and camera IDs can help provide important insights into the path a particular image or video has traveled during its time on the Internet without large computational overhead. This paper tests the scope and applicability of metadata-based inferences for provenance graph construction in two different scenarios: digital image forensics and cultural analytics.","rich insights, image provenance, metadatacreative works, pixels, provenance analysis, unregulated content, content"
"From antiheroes to new realism: French and Italian crime fiction in the twentieth and twenty-first centuryCrime fiction has been constantly present in Greek popular culture, mainly through translations published in newspapers, magazines and in book form, from the nineteenth century to the present day. While the Anglo-American influence on the development of Greek popular literature as a whole has undoubtedly been paramount since the beginning of the twentieth century, other national traditions have also played an important role. In this article, I provide an overview of cultural transfers between Greek, and French and Italian crime fiction in the twentieth and twenty-first century, taking into account the major influence of French culture and literature in Greece since the Enlightenment, and the common emergence of a new French and Italian crime fiction in translation after the 1990s. In particular, I look at the interplay between translated crime fiction and indigenous Greek texts, focusing on the emergence and …","new realism, nineteenth century, crime fiction, major influence, antiheroes, angloamerican influence"

"Editors’ Introduction: Marxism and Cultural StudiesCultural studies as a discipline and intellectual practice is deeply indebted to Marx, even as the field of cultural studies has contested, revisited, and updated Marx’s work. This issue points to a number of resonant threads currently active under the umbrella of cultural studies and opens possibilities for historical mapping of the many and varied aspects of marxist thought, in and out of the academy. The authors in this issue direct us toward and augment our understanding of the multi-faceted and inextricable links between questions of capital and questions of race, class, and gender power that have been the focus of US research in cultural studies especially within the past thirty years. In this issue, we continue and expand our editorial emphasis on the role of cultural studies in explaining and challenging the ongoing, intersectional significance of material power relations.Cultural studies as a discipline and intellectual practice is deeply indebted to Marx, even as the field of cultural studies has contested, revisited, and updated Marx’s work. The relationship between Marx, marxism, marxist thought, and cultural studies is richly defined through decades of scholarship, such that, though the discipline did not exist when Marx was writing, it is difficult to imagine cultural studies without Marx. Given how intertwined cultural studies is with Marx more than 150 years after the publication of Das Kapital, what shape does marxist cultural studies scholarship take today?

"Exploring deep-time relationships between cultural and genetic evolution in Northeast AsiaCulture evolves in ways that are analogous to, but distinct from, genetic evolution. Previous studies have demonstrated correlations between genetic and cultural diversity at small scales within language families, but few studies have empirically investigated parallels between genetic and cultural evolution across multiple language families using a diverse range of cultural data. Here we report an analysis comparing cultural and genetic data from 13 populations from in and around Northeast Asia spanning 10 different language families/isolates. We construct distance matrices for language (grammar, phonology, lexicon), music (song structure, performance style), and genomes (genome-wide SNPs) and test for correlations among them. After controlling for spatial autocorrelation and recent contact, robust correlations emerge between genetic and grammatical distances. Our results suggest that grammatical structure might be one of the strongest cultural indicators of human population history, while also demonstrating differences among cultural and genetic relationships that highlight the complex nature of human cultural and genetic evolution.","genetic evolution, deeptime relationships, structure, genetic data, language families, northeast asiaculture evolves, cultural diversity"
"From Extraction to Spotting for Cuneiform Script AnalysisCuneiform tablets appertain to the oldest textual artifacts used for more than three millennia and are comparable in amount and relevance to texts written in Latin or ancient Greek. We present a complete digital analysis workflow enabling modern text processing on the complex and non-linear script. Our tools encompass the whole pipeline, from digitization and wedge extraction to word-spotting and frequent pattern mining facilities. Tablets are being acquired from different sources requiring different methods for digitalization. Each representation is typically processed with its own tool-set. To homogenize these data sources, we introduce an unifying minimal wedge constellation description. For this representation, we develop similarity metrics based on the optimal assignment of wedge configurations. We combine our wedge features with work on segmentation-free word spotting using part-structured models.

"Dante’s Language and Linguistic Thought from the Vita Nova to theDante wrote in Florentine, the language spoken and written by the Florentines of his generation, throughout his career. Indeed, the phonological and morphological system present in his work coincides with that documented in non-literary texts written in the city during the last quarter of the thirteenth century. However, this fundamental characteristic is affected and partly altered by Dante’s experimentation with different literary genres and the evolution of his linguistic ideas. In fact, his activity as a poet and prose writer is often accompanied by acute and original linguistic self-awareness that runs parallel to the composition of his works, so that language and linguistic reflection complement each other. This is particularly true as regards vocabulary and syntax, which are influenced, more than phonology and morphology, by cultural factors, and are therefore affected more distinctively by the author’s linguistic and stylistic preferences, which vary from his early works to the Commedia.The Commedia–the culmination of Dante’s entire intellectual and literary trajectory–is his most Florentine work, the one that incorporates unfiltered Dante’s native vernacular. Dante exploits and simultaneously develops its resources and registers, while embracing and enriching the entire vertical range of lexical items, from the ‘lowest’to the most sophisticated, and from the plain and natural syntax of the spoken language to the complexities of philosophical and theological argument. Dante’s early lyric poetry (dating back to the 1280s) was instead influenced by the poetic language that developed in the wake of the ‘Sicilian School’at the court of Frederick II between 1230 …","vita nova, dante, linguistic reflection, linguistic thought, language"
"Domain engineering for generating dashboards to analyze employment and employability in the academic contextData analysis is a key process to foster knowledge generation regarding particular domains or fields of study. With a strong informative foundation derived from the analysis of collected data, decision-makers can make strategic choices with the aim of obtaining valuable benefits in their specific areas of action. However, given the steady growth of data volumes, data analysis needs to rely on powerful tools to enable knowledge extraction. Dashboards offer a software solution for visually analyzing large volumes of data in order to identify patterns and relations and make decisions according to the presented information. But decision-makers may have different goals and, consequently, different necessities regarding their dashboards.

"Are prominent mountains frequently mentioned in text? Exploring the spatial expressiveness of text frequencyData-driven GIScience shows a growing interest in making spatial information from large text data. In this paper, we quantify and thus evaluate the relation between text frequency and properties of the outer-text, geographic setting by comparing text frequencies of mountain names to the respective geomorphometric characteristics. We focus on some 2000 unique mountain names that appear some 50,000 times in a large compilation of texts on Swiss alpine history. The results on the full data set suggest only a weak relation: only 5–10% of the variation in the text frequency being explained by the respective geomorphometric characteristics. However, an analysis of multiple scales allows us to identify a Simpson’s Paradox. What appears to be ‘noise’ in the analysis of all mountains in the whole of Switzerland shows significant local signals.

"Learning Neural Emotion Analysis from 100 Observations: The Surprising Effectiveness of Pre-Trained Word RepresentationsDeep Learning has drastically reshaped virtually all areas of NLP. Yet on the downside, it is commonly thought to be dependent on vast amounts of training data. As such, these techniques appear ill-suited for areas where annotated data is limited, like emotion analysis, with its many nuanced and hard-to-acquire annotation formats, or other low-data scenarios encountered in under-resourced languages. In contrast to this popular notion, we provide empirical evidence from three typologically diverse languages that todays favorite neural architectures can be trained on a few hundred observations only. Our results suggest that high-quality, pre-trained word embeddings are crucial for achieving high performance despite such strong data limitations.Subjects: Computation and Language (cs.

These algorithms model objective facets of facial appearance, such as hair and eye color, expression, and aspects of the geometry of the face. A natural extension, which has not been studied to any great extent thus far, is the ability to model subjective attributes that are assigned to a face based purely on visual judgments. For instance, with just a glance, our first impression of a face may lead us to believe that a person is smart, worthy of our trust, and perhaps even our admiration — regardless of the underlying truth behind such attributes. Psychologists believe that these judgments are based on a variety of factors such as emotional states, personality traits, and other physiognomic cues.

"DP13287 Flight-to-safety and the Credit Crunch: A new history of the banking crisis in France during the Great DepressionDespite Frances importance in the interwar world economy, the scale and consequences of the French banking crises of 1930-1931 were never assessed quantitatively due to lack of data in the absence of banking regulation. Using a new dataset of individual balance sheets from more than 400 banks, we show that the crisis was more severe and occurred earlier than previously thought, and it was very asymmetric, without affecting main commercial banks. The primary transmission channel was a flight-to-safety of deposits from banks to savings institutions and the central bank, leading to a major, persistent disruption in business lending. In line with the gold standard mentality, cash deposited with savings institutions and the central bank was used to decrease marketable public debt and increase gold reserves, rather than pursue countercyclical policies. Despite massive capital inflows, France suffered from a …","savings institutions, france, credit crunch, interwar world economy, gold standard mentality, central bank, flighttosafety, banking crisis, new history"
"Co-mention network of R packages: Scientific impact and clustering structureDespite its rising position as a first-class research object, scientific software remains a marginal object in studies of scholarly communication. This study aims to fill the gap by examining the co-mention network of R packages across all Public Library of Science (PLoS) journals. To that end, we developed a software entity extraction method and identified 14,310 instances of R packages across the 13,684 PLoS journal papers mentioning or citing R. A paper-level co-mention network of these packages was visualized and analyzed using three major centrality measures: degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and PageRank. We analyzed the distributive patterns of R packages in all PLoS papers, identified the top packages mentioned in these papers, and examined the clustering structure of the network. Specifically, we found that the discipline and function of the packages can partly explain the largest clusters.

"1 Data modeling in a digital humanities contextDespite persistent ambivalence about the concept of “data” in humanities research, 1 there is a long and rich tradition of gathering and modeling information as part of humanities research practice. From the perspective of the digital humanities, that tradition now appears in retrospect like important prehistory for an understanding of data modeling. And that prehistory is significant not only because it shows how integral such activities have been to humanities research, but also because it reminds us of the distinctive complexities and challenges that humanities data poses. While the terms “data” and “modeling” may be new, many of the activities and intellectual frameworks they entail are familiar and deep-rooted. In a general sense, we understand intuitively that specific theoretical approaches rely on concepts and terms that divide the universe of ideas in specific ways. For instance, literary periodization constitutes a model of history in which spans of time are associated with distinct stylistic patterns and, indirectly, with cultural, economic, and historical phenomena that are presumed to influence those patterns and their evolution. The literary-historical approach is in itself a kind of general model, within whose terms more specific models could be framed and debated (for instance, concerning whether and how one might distinguish the medieval and Renaissance periods, and where the boundary falls in different national traditions). And we might reject the literary-historical way of modeling culture altogether, in favor of a model that disregards periodization, or that is","important prehistory, prehistory, rich tradition, specific theoretical approaches, humanities research, data modeling, data, tradition"
"Violins in the Subway: Scarcity Correlations, Evaluative Cultures, and Disciplinary Authority in the Digital HumanitiesDespite the proliferation of digital humanities projects, varying greatly in form and media, there remain anxieties about the evaluation of digital work. Digital humanists find, time and time again, that they are expected to perform twice the labour of traditional scholars; once for the work itself and once again for its evaluation. At the same time, traditional humanists often experience a sensation of threat from the digital arena, believing that it is easy to gain employment, grants, and tenure if one is a digital humanist.  In this chapter, I ask how we can understand a double logic in which digital-humanities work is at once so powerful as to crowd out the traditional humanists while at the same time so poorly understood as to need supplementation by traditional publication. Classifying the existing mechanisms of evaluation into a three-fold typology of 1.) a desired scarcity correlation; 2.) a set of media-specific denoting frames; and 3.) a set of disciplinary understandings, I show how and why DH remains radical in its work yet traditional in its outputs.","digital humanists, evaluative cultures, violins, traditional scholars, disciplinary authority, digital humanitiesdespite, scarcity correlations, digital humanities projects, traditional humanists"
"Exploiting the Web for Semantic Change DetectionDetecting significant linguistic shifts in the meaning and usage of words has gained more attention over the last few years. Linguis- tic shifts are especially prevalent on the Internet, where words’ meaning can change rapidly. In this work, we describe the construction of a large diachronic corpus that relies on the UK Web Archive and we propose a preliminary analysis of semantic change detection exploiting a particular technique called Temporal Random Indexing. Results of the evaluation are promising and give us important insights for further investigations.","temporal random indexing, web, preliminary analysis, significant linguistic shifts"
"Prototyping a Chatbot for Student Supervision in a Pre-Registration ProcessDeveloping a chatbot becomes a challenging task when it is built from scratch and independent of any Software as a Service (SaaS). Inspired by the idea of freeing lecturers from the burden of answering the same questions repetitively during the pre-registration process, this research has succeeded in building a textbased chatbot system. Further, this research has proved that the combination of keyword spotting technique for the Language Understanding component, Finite-State Transducer (FST) for the Dialogue Management, rulebased keyword matching for language generation, and the system-in-the-loop paradigm for system validation can produce an efficient chatbot. The chatbot efficiency is high enough as its score on Concept Efficiency (CE) reaches 0.946. It shows that users do not need to repeat their utterances several times to be understood. The chatbot performance on recognizing new concepts introduced by users is also more than satisfactory which is presented by its Query Density (QD) score of 0.80.","challenging task, language understanding component, concept efficiency, student supervision, keyword spotting technique, finitestate transducer, preregistration processdeveloping"

"Hubbard Bubble, Dianetics Trouble: An Evaluation of the Representations of Dianetics and Scientology in Science Fiction Magazines From 1949 to 1999Dianetics was unveiled to the public in the May 1950 edition of Astounding Science Fiction. Dianetics was the brainchild of science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard, and became the foundation for scientology toward the end of the decade. Dianetics was marketed as a “scientific” method for mental improvement—a robust alternative to conventional psychiatry—and was strongly debated in science fiction (sf) magazines. This article follows the trajectory of this cultural phenomenon from 1949 to 1999 as it appeared in this form of popular culture. A proximal reading method was applied to analyze 4,431 magazines, and identified 389 references to dianetics and scientology. References were found in advertising, reader letters, stories, feature articles, and editorials. Significant fluctuations in the prominence and perception of dianetics became clearly visible in the source material across a broad spectrum of content …","hubbard bubble, dianetics trouble, evaluation, mental improvement, magazines, robust alternative, scientology, cultural phenomenon, science fiction"
"Homelandings: postcolonial diasporas and transatlantic belongingDiasporic literary and film studies, in general, revolve around issues of cultural dislocation, cultural negotiations and cross-cultural translations and alliances that arise due to the entry of bodies from the global south, marked heterogeneously for race, culture, gender, class and sexuality, into the Western metropolis. In the line of works such as Queer Diasporas, a collection of essays edited by Cindy Patton and Beningo Sanchez-Eppler, and Gayathri Gopinath’s Impossible Desires, Rahul K. Gairola’s work is a rich addition to the repertoire of scholarship that throws light upon (the representations of) the experiences of black and brown queer diasporic figures in the West, a category of migrants under-represented in diasporic studies. The book, on the one hand, challenges a dominant trend in diaspora studies that views the diasporic subject as heterosexual, and, on the other hand, exposes the white-biases in queer studies and invites us to look at the latter discipline from the point of view queer of colour (migrant) subjects in the West.Building on the works of acclaimed scholars like Paul Gilroy and Elizabeth Povinelli which elucidate the formation of cultural and racial subjectivities owing to mobilities facilitated by the Atlantic Ocean and the governance of those subjectivities under regimes of liberalism, Gairola, in the first chapter, invokes the Atlantic Ocean as a site that can help us understand and unpack the forms of racialized power that configure queer (diasporic) homes in the age of neoliberalism.

"The Importance of Place and Openness in Spatial Humanities ResearchDigital Humanities (DH) is a dynamic and developing field. In recent years, its evolution has been witnessed foremost in the growth of funded DH projects and through the willingness of scholars from diverse backgrounds to not only work in DH research, but also as ‘digital humanists’. One crucial component to DH research is that of spatial enquiry, the expansion of which has rapidly evolved from a small component often found buried in research objectives, to the research aim of a growing number of projects. Spatial humanities, while still a relatively new interdisciplinary field, is exhibiting continued advancement and focus from the academic community; however, working with digital data is rarely a straightforward pursuit, even for the most accomplished scholar.

"Toward supporting decision-making under uncertainty in digital humanities with progressive visualizationDigital Humanities (DH) research and practice is subject to uncertainty during the life cycle of any project. Even in non data-oriented cases, analysts and other stakeholders need to make decisions without being aware of the level of uncertainty associated to the data being transformed by the computational tools used to enable the kind of novel work of humanists pursued within DH. We examine in this paper the literature that have characterized the types and sources of uncertainty in other fields, with the intent of establishing a foundation upon which build novel computational tools supporting the decision-making under uncertainty processes that DH is currently facing. We propose the use of progressive visual analytics as a feasible means to manage decision-making under uncertainty, which may help tackling some challenges related to the elimination or mitigation of uncertainty in DH, that otherwise would tamper …","cases, research, uncertainty, project, practice, life cycle, computational tools, digital humanities, progressive visualizationdigital humanities"

"The MUSETECH model: a comprehensive evaluation framework for museum technologyDigital technologies are being introduced in museums and other informal learning environments alongside more traditional interpretive and communication media. An increasing number of studies has proved the potential of digitally-mediated cultural heritage experiences. However, there is still a lot of controversy as to the advantages and disadvantages of introducing the digital into museum settings, primarily related to the risks and investment in terms of time, human and financial resources required. This work introduces the MUSETECH model, a comprehensive framework for evaluating museum technology before and after its introduction into a museum setting. One of the unique features of our framework is to consider the evaluation of digital technologies from three different perspectives: the perspective of the cultural heritage professional, the perspective of the cultural heritage institution and the perspective of the museum visitor. The framework benefited from an extensive review of the current state of the art and from inputs from cultural heritage professionals, designers and engineers. MUSETECH can be used as a tool for reflection, before, during and after introducing novel digital media resources. The model covers technologies as diverse as mobile museum guides, Augmented and Virtual Reality applications, hands-on museum interactives, edutainment applications, digitally-mediated tangible and embodied experiences or online approaches used for museum education and learning.","musetech model, museum settings, comprehensive evaluation framework, museum technologydigital technologies, heritage"
"Whither digital archaeological knowledge? The challenge of unstable futuresDigital technology increasingly pervades all settings of archaeological practice and virtually every stage of knowledge production. Through the digital we create, develop, manage and share our disciplinary crown jewels. However, technology adoption and digital mediation has not been uniform across all settings or stages. This diversity might be celebrated as reflecting greater openness and multivocality in the discipline, but equally it can be argued that such diversity is unsustainable, and that standards are insufficiently rigorous. Regardless, all positions face the possibility of being severely tested by some large-scale external event: on every continent we witness economic and political upheaval, violence and social conflict. How is digitally mediated knowledge created, managed, and disseminated by archaeologists today, and how secure are the means by which this is achieved? To investigate this question we apply the futurity technique of scenario analysis to generate plausible scenarios and assess their strategic strengths and weaknesses. Based on this analysis we propose some measures to place archaeology in a more robust knowledgescape without stifling digitally creative disruption.","challenge, digital archaeological knowledge, political upheaval, unstable futuresdigital technology, scenario analysis, technology adoption, greater openness, archaeological practice"

"Discipline Through Method: Recent history and philosophy of scientific psychology (1950-2018)Discipline Through Method investigates the disciplinary formation of scientific psychology in the second part of the twentieth century. In the period since the 1950s, research methods in scientific psychology were institutionalized across the varied communities of experimental, animal, educational, social, clinical, and applied psychologists. In the thesis, the epistemological implications of this institutionalization are discussed through the lens of existing historical and philosophical scholarship on scientific psychology’s methods, and the criticism of those methods that has been gaining steam in the reform movement forming around the replication crisis in 2010s. Although the conventions of institutionalized scientific psychology have allowed psychologists to expand their field drastically since World War II, the thesis casts a critical look on the question whether that expansion in number of practitioners, researchers, journal articles, and journals has actually lead to what the scientific community perceives as cumulative growth in psychological knowledge. Methods and disciplinary formation of psychology are approached in three ways: through textbooks, journals, and psychologists’ debates in the wake of the 2010s replication crisis. Textbooks were investigated as instructional manuals of disciplinary boundary-work, which provide expert psychologists with a platform for their broad views on the nature of psychology as a science. In particular, Hilgard’s Introduction to Psychology was investigated because it went through thirteen editions in the period from 1950 to 2000, providing a unique view on the authors’ choices in “updating” the textbook as …","scientific psychology, varied communities, research methods, replication crisis, disciplinary formation, methods, psychology"
"Polyomic tools for an emerging livestock parasite, the rumen fluke Calicophoron daubneyi; identifying shifts in rumen functionalityDiseases caused by parasitic flatworms of rumen tissues (paramphistomosis) are a significant threat to global food security as a cause of morbidity and mortality in ruminant livestock in subtropical and tropical climates. Calicophoron daubneyi is currently the only paramphistome species commonly infecting ruminant livestock in temperate European climates. However, recorded incidences of C. daubneyi infection in European livestock have been increasing over the last decade. Whilst clinical paramphistomosis caused by adult worms has not been confirmed in Europe, fatalities have been attributed to severe haemorrhagic enteritis of the small intestine resulting from the migration of immature paramphistomes. Large numbers of mature adults can reside in the rumen, yet to date, the impact on rumen fermentation, and consequently on productivity and economic management of infected livestock, have not been resolved. Limited publicly available nucleotide and protein sequences for C. daubneyi underpin this lack of biological and economic understanding. Here we present for the first time a de novo assembled transcriptome, with functional annotations, for adult C. daubneyi, which provides a reference database for protein and nucleotide sequence identification to facilitate fundamental biology, anthelmintic, vaccine and diagnostics discoveries. This dataset identifies a number of genes potentially unique to C. daubneyi and, by comparison to an existing transcriptome for the related Paramphistomum cervi, identifies novel genes which may be unique to the paramphistome group of platyhelminthes.

These are long-standing questions that have proven difficult to answer. To test between competing hypotheses, we constructed a massive repository of historical and archaeological information known as “Seshat: Global History Databank.” We systematically coded data on 414 societies from 30 regions around the world spanning the last 10,000 years. We were able to capture information on 51 variables reflecting nine characteristics of human societies, such as social scale, economy, features of governance, and information systems. Our analyses revealed that these different characteristics show strong relationships with each other and that a single principal component captures around three-quarters of the observed variation.

"Uptake and outcome of manuscripts in Nature journals by review model and author characteristicsDouble-blind peer review has been proposed as a possible solution to avoid implicit referee bias in academic publishing. The aims of this study are to analyse the demographics of corresponding authors choosing double blind peer review, and to identify differences in the editorial outcome of manuscripts depending on their review model. Data includes 128,454 manuscripts received between March 2015 and February 2017 by 25 Nature-branded journals. Author uptake for double-blind was 12%. We found a small but significant association between journal tier and review type. We found no statistically significant difference in the distribution of peer review model between males and females. We found that corresponding authors from the less prestigious institutions are more likely to choose double-blind review. In the ten countries with the highest number of submissions, we found a small but significant association between country and review type. The outcome at both first decision and post review is significantly more negative (ie a higher likelihood for rejection) for double than single-blind papers. Authors choose double-blind review more frequently when they submit to more prestigious journals, they are affiliated with less prestigious institutions or they are from specific countries; the double-blind option is also linked to less successful editorial outcomes.","editorial outcome, doubleblind, uptake, nature journals, implicit referee bias"

"A World of Fiction: Digital Collections and the Future of Literary HistoryDuring the 19th century, throughout the Anglophone world, most fiction was first published in periodicals. In Australia, newspapers were not only the main source of periodical fiction, but the main source of fiction in general. Because of their importance as fiction publishers, and because they provided Australian readers with access to stories from around the world—from Britain, America and Australia, as well as Austria, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, and beyond—Australian newspapers represent an important record of the transnational circulation and reception of fiction in this period.? Investigating almost 10,000 works of fiction in the world’s largest collection of mass-digitized historical newspapers (the National Library of Australia’s Trove database), A World of Fiction reconceptualizes how fiction traveled globally, and was received and understood locally, in the 19th century.

However, the question of which factors had more weight or impact than others in the process of the early spread of Egyptian cults has not yet been answered in academic discussion. This could be related to the fact that the issue of the spread of religious innovations in the ancient Mediterranean has been addressed mainly by established historiographical methods such as the collection and critical analysis of archaeological and literary sources. Hypotheses and conclusions derived from these methods are, however, often unable to reflect the complexity of historical processes. A possible solution can be found in supplementing this established methodological apparatus by formalized methods, e.g. the coding of relevant datasets, statistics, geospatial modeling, and network analysis. To be able to compare the possible impacts of different factors on the spread of Egyptian cults in the Aegean Sea region, we 1) constructed a model of the ancient maritime transportation network as a platform for quantitative analysis, 2) transformed selected factors of possible influence into georeferenced parameters of the network, and 3) defined a mathematical model that allowed us to determine which parameters of the network explain the spatial dissemination of archaeological evidence connected to Egyptian cults. The results suggest that the most significant …","egyptian cults, aegean sea, analysis, spread, ptolemaic era, ptolemaic military operations, methods"
"Embodied, participatory sense-making in digitally-augmented music practices: theoretical principles and the artistic case “SoundBikes”Electronic and digital technologies open immense opportunities for music composition, listening, interaction, and participation. However, at the same time, they critically challenge some of the most basic principles that drive human engagement and interaction with music. This article first presents a theoretical discussion of two of these principles, namely sensorimotor control and participatory sense-making. Thereafter, it presents SoundBikes, a music installation that implements these theoretical considerations. SoundBikes is rooted in the idea that collective music-making is a form of participatory sense-making that emerges from embodied, dynamical and collaborative interactions between co-performers. The core components of SoundBikes include an EMS Synthi 100 and two stationary bikes equipped with sensors. To stimulate social interaction and collaboration between cyclist-performers, we designed …","music composition, theoretical principles, sensorimotor control, participatory sensemaking, digital technologies, digitallyaugmented music practices"
"A Survey on Sentiment and Emotion Analysis for Computational Literary StudiesEmotions have often been a crucial part of compelling narratives: literature tells about people with goals, desires, passions, and intentions. In the past, classical literary studies usually scrutinized the affective dimension of literature within the framework of hermeneutics. However, with emergence of the research field known as Digital Humanities (DH) some studies of emotions in literary context have taken a computational turn. Given the fact that DH is still being formed as a science, this direction of research can be rendered relatively new. At the same time, the research in sentiment analysis started in computational linguistic almost two decades ago and is nowadays an established field that has dedicated workshops and tracks in the main computational linguistics conferences. This leads us to the question of what are the commonalities and discrepancies between sentiment analysis research in computational linguistics and digital humanities? In this survey, we offer an overview of the existing body of research on sentiment and emotion analysis as applied to literature. We precede the main part of the survey with a short introduction to natural language processing and machine learning, psychological models of emotions, and provide an overview of existing approaches to sentiment and emotion analysis in computational linguistics. The papers presented in this survey are either coming directly from DH or computational linguistics venues and are limited to sentiment and emotion analysis as applied to literary text.","compelling narratives, emotion analysis, sentiment, computational literary studiesemotions, crucial part, survey, digital humanities, computational linguistics"
"Automatically Encoding Encyclopedic-like Resources in TEIEncyclopedic content exists in different forms of paper-based resources and remains to a very large extent not exploited given the limited alternatives to extract information from the corresponding digitized material. Where TEI has provided mechanisms for encoding such a content, recent works have yielded advanced techniques to apply these mechanisms automatically on raw resources, however clear recommendations for the encoding of such content is still lacking.As current digitization projects concern encyclopedias, other projects are undertaken to digitize textual resources with heritage significance and with similar features in terms of layout and indexed access. In this paper we introduce new lexicographic models, customizing the TEI schema, we extend existing ones and we present their application on two categories of resources, currently under development to be made available for public use:• Encyclopedic sections of early, out of copyright, versions of a reference French","paperbased resources, raw resources, projects, teiencyclopedic content, encyclopediclike resources, limited alternatives, content, clear recommendations, advanced techniques"

"People, transports and the spread of the Argentine and in Europe, from c. 1850 to the presentEnvironmental history is increasingly contributing to the research on bioinvasions. It investigates the vectors of introduction, people’s perceptions and societal responses. Historical narratives of introduction processes and spread may help improve current preventive and management practices designed to mitigate impacts in the economy, ecology and people’s well-being. In this framework, we study the introduction of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile Mayr) in Europe since the nineteenth century when the species was perceived as inconvenient and harmful. A narrative of the expansion combines historical material from different sources, origins and scales and examines pathways through time. We conclude that the species arrived to different regions of Europe through independent processes, associated with travel and trade, and strictly connected with the evolution of transportations.","processes, people, presentenvironmental history, societal responses, transports, historical narratives"
"Edinburgh and the Birth of British Evolutionism: A Peek behind a Veil of AnonymityErasmus Darwins evolutionary verses were isolated and ephemeral philosophical speculations. The real and academic birth of British evolutionism took place a couple of decades later in Edinburgh. It is probably no coincidence that the first fruits of this evolutionary theorizing were published during the approximately 2 years (1825–1827) that Erasmuss illustrious grandson Charles studied there: His evolutionary thinking was almost certainly more inspired by the first wave of British evolutionary theorizing than he later acknowledged or maybe even remembered. Unfortunately, we still don’t know with certainty the identity of the authors of some of the key manifestations of this theorizing. Our identification, with the help of modern author verification software, of the authors of two of these anonymous evolutionary articles, published in 1826 and 1827, confirms that Darwins geology professor Robert Jameson played a …","academic birth, ephemeral philosophical speculations, evolutionary theorizing, anonymityerasmus darwin, illustrious grandson charles, british evolutionism, evolutionary verses, geology professor robert jameson, edinburgh"
"Eric Wittkower and the foundation of Montréal’s Transcultural Psychiatry Research Unit after World War IIEric Wittkower founded McGill University’s Transcultural Psychiatry Unit in 1955. One year later, he started the first international newsletter in this academic field: Transcultural Psychiatry. However, at the beginning of his career Wittkower gave no signs that he would be interested in social sciences and psychiatry. This paper describes the historical context of the post-war period, when Wittkower founded the research unit in Montréal. I focus on the history of scientific networks and the circulation of knowledge, and particularly on the exchanges between the French- and English-speaking academic cultures in North America and Europe. Because the history of transcultural psychiatry is a transnational history par excellence, this leads necessarily to the question of the reception of this academic field abroad.","transcultural psychiatry unit, transcultural psychiatry research unit, eric wittkower, world war iieric wittkower, history, academic cultures, transcultural psychiatry, mcgill university"

"Birds of a feather scam together: Trustworthiness homophily in a business networkEstimating the trustworthiness of a set of actors when all the available information is provided by the actors themselves is a hard problem. When two actors have conflicting reports about each other, how do we establish which of the two (if any) deserves our trust? In this paper, we model this scenario as a network problem: actors are nodes in a network and their reports about each other are the edges of the network. To estimate their trustworthiness levels, we develop an iterative framework which looks at all the reports about each connected actor pair to define its trustworthiness balance. We apply this framework to a customer/supplier business network. We show that our trustworthiness score is a significant predictor of the likelihood a business will pay a fine if audited. We show that the market network is characterized by homophily: businesses tend to connect to partners with similar trustworthiness degrees. This …","supplier business network, feather scam, similar trustworthiness degrees, framework, network, birds"

"Ancient Fennoscandian genomes reveal origin and spread of Siberian ancestry in EuropeEuropean history has been shaped by migrations of people, and their subsequent admixture. Recently, evidence from ancient DNA has brought new insights into migration events that could be linked to the advent of agriculture, and possibly to the spread of Indo-European languages. However, little is known so far about the ancient population history of north-eastern Europe, in particular about populations speaking Uralic languages, such as Finns and Saami. Here we analyse ancient genomic data from 11 individuals from Finland and Northwest Russia. We show that the specific genetic makeup of northern Europe traces back to migrations from Siberia that began at least 3,500 years ago. This ancestry was subsequently admixed into many modern populations in the region, in particular populations speaking Uralic languages today. In addition, we show that ancestors of modern Saami inhabited a larger territory during the Iron Age than today, which adds to historical and linguistic evidence for the population history of Finland.","ancient fennoscandian genomes, siberian ancestry, population history, new insights, populations, uralic languages, europeeuropean history, indoeuropean languages"
"Images on the Move: Analytics for a Mixed Methods ApproachEverything I want to say about the need for video analytics (broadly deﬁned as the use of computational methods to analyze ﬁlmic archives), as a component of humanities research is encoded in the above epigraph. The essay from which it is taken,“Style and Medium in the Motion Pictures”(2002 1934), was written over 80 years ago. A highly respected art historian, Panofsky argued that cinema should be considered art, his somewhat qualiﬁed claim and resignation notwithstanding. His reference to the public inﬂuence of media, as well as his use of statistical evidence (regardless of the precision of his “60 percent”), are emblematic of current debates in the humanities-those framed as “public humanities” and “digital human ities,” respectively. Quantiﬁcation is a somewhat odd move for someone so famous for close-reading the iconography of visual art, and yet I argue that it provides essential context for qualitative …","analytics, computational methods, images, video analytics, mixed methods, ﬁlmic archives, respected art historian, humanities research, move"
"Chasing the butterfly effect: Informal language learning online as a complex systemEvidence is accumulating that a major shift is underway in the ways that second language (L2) development is taking place. Increasingly, especially among young people, that process is occurring outside of institutional settings, predominately through the use of online networks and media. That phenomenon has been particularly noticed for learners of English, as shown in recent studies of fully autonomous learners in Brazil (Cole & Vanderplank, 2016) and predominantly recreational L2 users in Europe (Kusyk, 2017; Sundqvist & Sylvén, 2016). One of the hallmarks of this kind of language development is the great variety of approaches and materials used (ie, social media, online participation in affinity spaces, watching videos, listening to music, engaging in online learning communities). The availability of immense quantities of spoken and written content in open (or inexpensively available) online channels, most also accessible on mobile devices, opens up countless opportunities for users to mix and match as never before tools, services, media, and group participation in ways that accommodate individual L2 needs and preferences.Understanding the dynamics at work in this development, as compared to classroom-based learning, is no easy task. L2 learners and users have a rich variety of choices in online resources and have various motives and goals in accessing L2 materials and in interacting with L2 communities. In fact, they may not be focused on language learning at all, but rather may be seeking entertainment or simply socializing (Sockett, 2014).

"Interactions between whole-body heating and citalopram on body temperature, antidepressant-like behaviour, and neurochemistry in adolescent male ratsEvidence suggests that affective disorders are associated with altered thermoregulation, and it has been hypothesized that therapeutic strategies targeting body-to-brain thermosensory systems may be effective for treating depression. Consistent with this hypothesis, a recent randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial has suggested that infrared whole-body hyperthermia has therapeutic potential for the treatment of depression. Preclinical models may help uncover the mechanism(s) underlying the antidepressant-like effects of whole-body heating. We have previously shown that exposure to whole-body heating potentiates antidepressant-like behavioural responses following administration of a behaviourally subthreshold dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram, but the neurochemical and behavioural interactions between whole body heating and behaviourally effective doses of …","wholebody heating, antidepressantlike behaviour, altered thermoregulation, interactions, body temperature, clinical trial, adolescent male ratsevidence, affective disorders, bodytobrain thermosensory systems, therapeutic strategies"
"Model discrimination for Ca2+‐dependent regulation of myosin light chain kinase in smooth muscle contractionExcitation‐contraction coupling in smooth muscle is mediated by the Ca2+‐ and calmodulin‐dependent regulation of myosin light chain kinase. The precise mechanism of this regulation remains controversial, and several mathematical models have been proposed for the interaction of the three species. These models have previously been analyzed at steady state primarily by numerical simulation of differential equations, for which parameter values must be estimated from data. Here, we use the linear framework for timescale separation to demonstrate that models of this general kind can be solved analytically for an equilibrium steady state, without having to determine parameter values. This analysis leads to parameter‐independent methods for discriminating between the models, for which we propose experiments that could be performed with existing methods.","steady state, model discrimination, light chain, smooth muscle, precise mechanism"
"Imperatives in Past Online Discussions: Another Helpful Source for Community Newcomers?Experienced members of online communities use discussion to familiarize newcomers with norms. These members use imperatives, a kind of directive speech act, to suggest a course of action. A method for automatically recognizing such imperatives is described here. The recognition performance of the algorithm is compared to that of human readers. In addition, to test and illustrate the technique, the imperatives in a sample of Wikipedia deletion discussions are extracted, analyzed, and discussed. The method may be used not only to understand a community’s culture and practices but also to elicit information that is beneficial to the community’s newcomers.","online discussions, newcomers, members, community, directive speech act, online communities, helpful source"

"To Frontalize or Not to Frontalize: Do We Really Need Elaborate Pre-processing to Improve Face Recognition?Face recognition performance has improved remarkably in the last decade. Much of this success can be attributed to the development of deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While CNNs have pushed the state-of-the-art forward, their training process requires a large amount of clean and correctly labelled training data. If a CNN is intended to tolerate facial pose, then we face an important question: should this training data be diverse in its pose distribution, or should face images be normalized to a single pose in a pre-processing step? To address this question, we evaluate a number of facial landmarking algorithms and a popular frontalization method to understand their effect on facial recognition performance. Additionally, we introduce a new, automatic, single-image frontalization scheme that exceeds the performance of the reference frontalization algorithm for video-to-video …","training data, elaborate preprocessing, facial pose, popular frontalization method, convolutional neural networks, single pose, facial landmarking algorithms"
"Avoiding Failure to Fail: a role for triangulationFailure to fail healthcare students during assessed practice placements has been a recognised problem for some time. Despite identification of the problem and an acknowledgement of the associated issues there have been limited suggestions about how the validity and reliability of practice competency assessment can be improved. This paper explores these issues and investigates whether the development of a practice assessment system that incorporates a scale of competence and triangulation of evidence from multiple sources may assist mentors to arrive at more robust decisions about a student’s performance. Whilst the evidence base supporting the use of triangulation in practice assessment is weak, such systems may be of assistance because they prevent the decision about a failure in practice being based on a single person’s judgement. The combinations of multiple methods of assessment are likely to be more reliable and valid than any system which relies solely on an individual’s judgement.    This article will outline how one University developed an innovative system of practice assessment based on the use of triangulation and criterion referenced assessment. The system utilised existing Nursing and Midwifery Council competencies and instigated assessment using a scale of competence with observed performance triangulated with a range of robust assessment tools to provide a valid and reliable assessment.","failure, healthcare students, performance, robust decisions, practice placements, practice assessment, multiple sources, innovative system"
"The population history of northeastern Siberia since the PleistoceneFar northeastern Siberia has been occupied by humans for more than 40 thousand years. Yet, owing to a scarcity of early archaeological sites and human remains, its population history and relationship to ancient and modern populations across Eurasia and the Americas are poorly understood. Here, we report 34 ancient genome sequences, including two from fragmented milk teeth found at the ~31.6 thousand-year-old (kya) Yana RHS site, the earliest and northernmost Pleistocene human remains found. These genomes reveal complex patterns of past population admixture and replacement events throughout northeastern Siberia, with evidence for at least three large-scale human migrations into the region. The first inhabitants, a previously unknown population of ""Ancient North Siberians"" (ANS), represented by Yana RHS, diverged ~38 kya from Western Eurasians, soon after the latter split from East Asians. Between 20 and 11 kya, the ANS population was largely replaced by peoples with ancestry from East Asia, giving rise to ancestral Native Americans and ""Ancient Paleosiberians"" (AP), represented by a 9.8 kya skeleton from Kolyma River. AP are closely related to the Siberian ancestors of Native Americans, and ancestral to contemporary communities such as Koryaks and Itelmen. Paleoclimatic modelling shows evidence for a refuge during the last glacial maximum (LGM) in southeastern Beringia, suggesting Beringia as a possible location for the admixture forming both ancestral Native Americans and AP. Between 11 and 4 kya, AP were in turn largely replaced by another group of peoples with ancestry from East Asia, the ""Neosiberians"" …","ancient, early archaeological sites, human remains, population history, northeastern siberia"

As we will show, the current prototype system is able to provide diversity-based route recommendation for city areas in San Fransisco and Kyoto.","route recommendation, city, diversitybased route recommendation"
"Data Scopes: towards transparent data research in Digital HumanitiesFor quite some time, humanities scholars have been using digital tools in addition to their established methodology to try and make sense of large and expanding data sources that cannot be handled with traditional methods alone. The digital methods have computer science aspects that may be combined with but do not readily fit into humanities methodology; an issue which is still too implicit in scholarly debate. This gives rise to a need for methodological consolidation to structure the combination of digital and established humanities methods. In this paper, we propose an approach to such consolidation, that we call data scopes","humanities scholars, transparent data research, methods, data scopes, digital tools, methodological consolidation"

"Katherine Mansfield and the Bloomsbury GroupFor the editor, pragmatism has ‘something to say to everyone’(p.). However, the book is most successful when it is aware of the difficulties this poses. When a thinker has such a broad influence as James, it is hard to know, in Ross Posnock’s words cited by Evans,‘where to draw the line’(p.). But this does not mean we are allowed to say whatever we want and call it ‘truth’, and Patricia Rae notes that James rejected any such ‘free-for-all’(p.). Because James ‘even called himself “an epistemological realist”’, Alan Malachowsky reminds us (p.), truth is neither relative nor a given, but occurs only after continually testing it against experience. is aspect of James’s thought has been excitingly renewed by Bruno Latour, only briefly mentioned here (p.), to refuse the false choice between constructivism and naturalism.

"Micro-Targeting and ICT media in the Dutch Parliamentary system: Technological changes in Dutch DemocracyFor the period surrounding the 2018 Dutch municipal elections, a team of researchers from the Delft University of Technology investigated the effect of the digital environment on parliamentary democracy. An interdisciplinary group of researchers combined expertise on digital ethics, political theory, big data analytics, the economics of privacy and security, epistemology, media studies and computer science. This report presents the main findings, which are grouped around two main themes: political micro-targeting and ICT media. Societal themes that came to prominence over the research period, such as the debate over ‘fake news’ and the leaks of personal information that were used for political purposes by Facebook, as well as the implementation of new EU privacy regulation helped to put the research in a larger political context. The main findings provide a qualified picture. The influence of the digital revolution on democratic politics is already revolutionary, and the weaknesses of online platforms provide ample opportunities for derailing liberal democracy. Digital platforms are too closed-off, not mindful enough of individual digital rights, and biased in their (re)presentation of political pluralism. But the Netherlands has proven to be one of the few democracies that is relatively resilient, with an open multi-party system receptive to the political fragmentation that ICT developments encourage, and relatively high trust between citizens, in shared media organizations, and between political parties. In order not to be complacent in the face of fundamental challenges, the report provides several urgent recommendations.

"Filelfo, Cicero and Epistolary Style: a Computational StudyFrancesco Filelfo has written many things as an orator and as a poet, and the learned opinion of his letters, dialogues, orations and other prose works is varied. For many are of the opinion that he lacks good judgment: some think his Latin is bombastic and abundant, others that it is meagre and very often dry and spiritless, even if he himself seemed to like it very much. 1It appears that, besides contradictorily characterizing his style as bombastic (tumidus) and abundant (plenus) on the one hand, and meagre (exilis), dry (aridus) and spiritless (ieiunus) on the other, most critics especially found fault with Filelfo’s stylistic judgement or iudicium. Part of the technical terminology of ancient rhetorical theory and humanist poetics, iudicium figures as one of the three necessary qualities of a good writer, together with ingenium (natural talent) and consilium (prudence).

"Digital Methods for Service Design. Experimenting with data-driven frameworksFrom logs and information left in online spaces to data points self-generated by connected devices, digital traces have become more and more diffused over the past years. Along with some big-data approaches, Digital Methods of research-treating the actual content of users’ manifestation online (ie tweets, Instagram pictures, comments)-offer the opportunity to better understand people and behaviours through their online activities. This paper investigates how Digital Methods can be repurposed as a full-fledged approach for the Service Design practice, by offering a method to outline service design frameworks from a corpus of web data. These quantitative methods, in combination with the traditional qualitative ethnographic approaches, leverage the continuous exchange of information that is happening in the digital space and suggest the possibility to automate parts of the data collection and analysis processes in support of service design activities. Grafting on several case studies-we will explain how Digital Methods could be used to identify and describe a set of personas by extracting and interpreting data from their online activities, and we will inquire into the application of the same methodological approach to map other frameworkssuch as experience journeys or system maps-that are critical to Service Design.","data points, approaches, digital methods, connected devices, online spaces, frameworksfrom logs, service design"

"Anti-Gravitational Choreographies: Strategies of Mobility in ScreendanceFrom the perspective of the digital choreographies I discuss in this essay, twentieth-century modern and postmodern dance techniques are notable for their shared faith in gravity and weight. From Doris Humphrey’s Fall and Recovery, to Joan Skinner’s Releasing Technique, and Contact Improvisation developed by Steve Paxton and others, twentieth-century, Euro-American dance techniques cultivate a weight-filled dancing body rooted to or in tensile relation with the ground. This ground, generally configured as a stable field for dancers to push away from, give in to, or move across, is only one option among many in choreographies for the screen, and is often rendered unstable in its appearance. Similarly, weight is treated as more of an aesthetic choice than a physical reality. In screendance, what I am calling anti-gravitational choreographies regard ground and weight with playful suspicion as they replace twentieth-century metaphors of groundedness and rootedness with levitation. Technologically unfixed, anti-gravitational dancers imagine an unpredictable ground over which they hover, glide, suspend, skim, and float; or else they do not imagine a ground at all. Such choreographies thereby give dancers back their lightness but not the gravity-defying escape velocities, for which early modern dancers roundly criticized ballet. 1Mediations of dance, from print to film or digital video, offer frequent reformulations of dancing bodies’ relationships to gravity and ground. They thus present opportunities for re-examining what cultural assumptions underlie the ways dancing bodies inhabit space—they make visible what familiarity has rendered invisible …","antigravitational choreographies, postmodern dance techniques, digital choreographies, doris humphrey"
"Towards an Open Standard for Gameplay MetricsGameplay Metrics can help provide insights into player behaviour and performance, supporting game designers and players wishing to better understand their own game, yet such data is often not easily available to the wider public. We take our inspiration from the field of Learning Analytics, which attempts to create awareness and insights for learners by leveraging the gathered activity data and feeding this back to the students in an open way. This paper suggests an open standard for gathering and storing Gameplay Metrics data based on proven standards in Learning Analytics, facilitating easier development of analytical tools across different video games and genres to the benefit of researchers, developers, and players.","learning analytics, gameplay metricsgameplay metrics, game designers, gameplay metrics data, open standard, player behaviour"
"Bleaching Text: Abstract Features for Cross-lingual Gender PredictionGender prediction has typically focused on lexical and social network features, yielding good performance, but making systems highly language-, topic-, and platform-dependent. Cross-lingual embeddings circumvent some of these limitations, but capture gender-specific style less. We propose an alternative: bleaching text, ie, transforming lexical strings into more abstract features. This study provides evidence that such features allow for better transfer across languages. Moreover, we present a first study on the ability of humans to perform cross-lingual gender prediction. We find that human predictive power proves similar to that of our bleached models, and both perform better than lexical models.","crosslingual gender, genderspecific style, bleaching text, social network features, good performance, crosslingual embeddings"

"Stemmatology: an R package for the computer-assisted analysis of textual traditionsGiven a set of witnesses of a text, determining their relations and reconstructing a stemma codicum is one of the fundamental purposes of textual criticism and philology. For this task, various computer-assisted procedures and methods have been described since the 1950s, some elaborating on traditional principles (Lachmannian, Quentinian.. .), some borrowed from other fields such as phylogenetics. In this poster, we describe Stemmatology, a new open source package for the statistical software R, that implements procedures for the computer-assisted analysis of textual traditions. We have started implementation of stemmatological methods in the package by focusing, on one hand, on procedures derived from traditional textual criticism, the "" Lach-mannian "" tradition in general, and particularly some of Eric Pooles method-ological insights (Poole 13, 14); and on the other hand, we made use of methods for the detection of contamination and polygenesis, two major issues for genealogical analysis.","stemmatology, stemma codicum, fundamental purposes, methods, textual traditionsgiven, new open source package, computerassisted analysis"
"How to improve policy making using open data in virtual research environments: an interactive workshop discussing privacy, security and trust strategiesGovernments and publicly-funded research institutions increasingly open up data collected and created through research. One way to share and use data obtained through research is through Virtual Research Environments (VREs). Insights obtained through open data use in VREs can subsequently provide input for policy making. However, this process involves many privacy, security and trust issues both for VRE developers and for end-users. We still know very little about what strategies can be used to handle these security, privacy and trust issues. This 1, 5 hour interactive workshop aims to discuss and refine strategies for handling privacy, security and trust issues of VREs and their users as developed in the European VRE4EIC project. The workshop will facilitate open discussions making use of the interactive Mentimeter tool to involve all participants in the sharing of practices and in sharing feedback on the …","research, open data, research institutions, policy making, trust strategiesgovernments, virtual research environments, data, interactive workshop"
"Functional structures of US state governmentsGovernments in modern societies undertake an array of complex functions that shape politics and economics, individual and group behavior, and the natural, social, and built environment. How are governments structured to execute these diverse responsibilities? How do those structures vary, and what explains the differences? To examine these longstanding questions, we develop a technique for mapping Internet “footprint” of government with network science methods. We use this approach to describe and analyze the diversity in functional scale and structure among the 50 US state governments reflected in the webpages and links they have created online: 32.5 million webpages and 110 million hyperlinks among 47,631 agencies. We first verify that this extensive online footprint systematically reflects known characteristics: 50 hierarchically organized networks of state agencies that scale with population and …","diverse responsibilities, functional structures, agencies, online, group behavior, shape politics, modern societies, governments"
"Navigating Copyright in Electronic Theses and DissertationsGraduate students completing an electronic thesis or dissertation (ETD) may encounter issues related to copyright, either their own or that held by others, at several points throughout the creation and submission of their ETD. Since ETDs are often hosted in an institutional repository or other online collection hosted by the library, library personnel involved in the process must be aware of these points of failure and understand the nuances of copyright with regard to reuse of materials, their institution’s policies governing student scholarship, and the policies of their institutional repository or online collection. This poster will review the relevant literature related to copyright and ETDs, outline the major junctures where librarians may contribute to copyright education for graduate students (and others), and offer suggestions for librarians seeking to engage with graduate students completing their ETDs.","points, dissertationsgraduate students, electronic thesis, electronic theses"
"Low-Resource Machine Transliteration Using Recurrent Neural NetworksGrapheme-to-phoneme models are key components in automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech systems. With low-resource language pairs that do not have available and well-developed pronunciation lexicons, grapheme-to-phoneme models are particularly useful. These models are based on initial alignments between grapheme source and phoneme target sequences. Inspired by sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network--based translation methods, the current research presents an approach that applies an alignment representation for input sequences and pretrained source and target embeddings to overcome the transliteration problem for a low-resource languages pair. Evaluation and experiments involving French and Vietnamese showed that with only a small bilingual pronunciation dictionary available for training the transliteration models, promising results were obtained with a large …","graphemetophoneme models, welldeveloped pronunciation lexicons, lowresource machine transliteration, automatic speech recognition, texttospeech systems, key components"
"What Are You Trying to Say? The Interface as an Integral Element of ArgumentGraphical interfaces to digital scholarly editions are usually regarded as disconnected from the content of the edition, enough so that an argument has developed against the use of interfaces at all. We argue in this paper that the indifference and even hostility to interfaces is caused by a widespread incomprehension of their argumentative utility. In a pair of case studies of published digital editions, we conduct a detailed examination of the argument their interface makes, and compare these interface rhetoricswiththe statedintentionsof the editors, exposing anumberof contradictions between ‘word’and ‘deed’in the interface designs. We end by advocating for an explicit consideration of the semiotic significance of the elements of a user interface: that editors reflect on what aspect of the argument their interface expresses, and how that is adding, or perhaps subtracting, from the points they wish to make.","argumentgraphical interfaces, interfaces, argument, integral element, scholarly editions"
"Data from an electronic health informatics pipeline to describe clearance dynamics of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and e-Antigen (HBeAg) in chronic HBV infectionHBsAg and HBeAg have gained traction as biomarkers of control and clearance during monitoring of chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHB). An improved understanding of the correlates of clearance of these proteins could help inform improvements in patient-stratified care and advance insights into the underlying mechanisms of disease control, thus underpinning new cure strategies. We collected electronic clinical data via an electronic pipeline supported by the National Institute for Health Research Health Informatics Collaborative (NIHR-HIC), adopting an unbiased approach to generating a robust longitudinal dataset for adults testing HBsAg-positive from a large UK teaching hospital over a six year period (2011-2016 inclusive). From 553 individuals with CHB, longitudinal data were available for 319, representing >107,000 weeks of clinical follow-up. Among these 319 individuals, 13 (4%) cleared HBsAg completely. HBsAg clearance rate was similar in individuals on NA therapy (n=4, median clearance time 150 weeks) vs those not on NA therapy (n=9, median clearance time 157 weeks). Those who cleared HBsAg were significantly older, and less likely to be on NA therapy compared to non-clearers (p=0.003 and p=0.001, respectively). Chinese ethnicity was associated with HBeAg positivity (p=0.025). HBeAg clearance occurred both on NA therapy (n=24, median time 49 weeks) and off NA therapy (n=19, median time 52 weeks). Improved insights into the dynamics of these biomarkers can underpin better prognostication and patient-stratified care.

"SHMT2 and the BRCC36/BRISC deubiquitinase regulate HIV-1 Tat K63-ubiquitylation and destruction by autophagyHIV-1 Tat is a key regulator of viral transcription, however little is known about the mechanisms that control its turnover in T cells. Here we use a novel proteomics technique, called DiffPOP, to identify the molecular target of JIB-04, a small molecule compound that potently and selectively blocks HIV-1 Tat expression, transactivation, and virus replication in T cell lines. Mass-spectrometry analysis of whole-cell extracts from 2D10 Jurkat T cells revealed that JIB-04 targets Serine Hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2), a regulator of glycine biosynthesis and an adaptor for the BRCC36 K63Ub-specific deubiquitinase in the BRISC complex. Importantly, knockdown of SHMT1,2 or BRCC36, or exposure of cells to JIB-04, strongly increased Tat K63Ub-dependent destruction via autophagy. Moreover, point mutation of multiple lysines in Tat, or knockdown of BRCC36 or SHMT1,2, was sufficient to prevent destruction of Tat by JIB-04. We conclude that HIV-1 Tat levels are regulated through K63Ub-selective autophagy mediated through SHMT1,2 and the BRCC36 deubiquitinase.","hiv1 tat k63ubiquitylation, key regulator, brcc36 k63ubspecific deubiquitinase, brcc36, shmt2, viral transcription"
"Mighty Poets: Hartley Coleridge and William WordsworthHartley Coleridge has often been dismissed as little more than a minor poet driven to drink by his angst over a poetic inheritance passed down by his father, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and mentor, William Wordsworth. Poems like Wordsworth’s “To H.C. Six Years Old” were particularly influential in establishing a myth of Hartley as a faery creature who was ill-suited for adult life. Yet, Hartley challenged this myth in his own poetry and, as this essay argues, transformed it into a mode for critiquing not only his literary relationships with the first-generation Romantics, but also for assessing Wordsworth’s later poetry. Further, this essay suggests that Hartley’s poetic responses to Wordsworth indicate growing confidence in his literary talents, and articulate his claims to be considered as an important Lake Poet in his own right.","hartley, mighty poets, samuel taylor coleridge, william wordsworthhartley coleridge, hartley coleridge, william wordsworth"
"Digital History meets Microblogging: Analyzing Collective Memories in TwitterHaving good knowledge and comprehension of history is believed to be important for a variety of reasons. Microblogging platforms could offer good opportunities to study how and when people explicitly refer to the past, in which context such references appear and what purpose they serve. However, this area remains unexplored. In this paper we report the results of a large scale exploratory analysis of history-focused references in microblogs based on 11-months long snapshot of Twitter data. We are the first to analyze general historical references in Twitter based on large scale data analysis. The results of this study can be used for designing content recommendation systems and could help to improve time aware search applications.","twitter data, general historical references, digital history, historyfocused references, collective memories"
"Designing a Data Visualization Dashboard for Managing the Sustainability Communication of Healthcare Organizations on FacebookHealthcare organizations are being increasingly requested to publicize their sustainability efforts on digital environments and social media, in part because previously passive patients are now becoming active customers. This paper investigates how leading healthcare organizations are using Facebook to communicate their sustainability, in terms of their focus on different components of the 3Ps (people, profit, planet) and interactive communication strategies used on social media. A content analysis was made of the Facebook posts (n= 6145) of healthcare organizations in the Forbes Global 2000 (2017 annual ranking) from 2015 to mid-2018. Our findings show that the social component of sustainability prevails over environmental and economic issues, although it does not seem to generate increased consumer engagement (in terms of users’ likes, comments, reactions, etc.). A data visualization dashboard was developed to help managers in benchmarking competitors and assessing how they can increase response rates and public engagement on social media, thus encouraging the active participation of users. The study also provides useful insights for communication managers in identifying how to use deliberative tools to develop consumer relationships on social media and aligning companies and consumers regarding shared sustainability themes.

This article presents the development and thermal characterization of composite foam insulation boards containing low-cost vacuum insulation cores. The composite foam-vacuum insulation boards were created in a semi-automatic operation in a foam insulation manufacturing plant. The low-cost vacuum insulation is a new technology called modified atmosphere insulation. The production process of modified atmosphere insulation is much simpler than traditional vacuum insulation manufacturing, and it has the potential for significant cost reduction at the same thermal performance. Prototypes of small- and full-scale composite insulation boards were created for testing and evaluation under laboratory and natural weatherization conditions.

"Generous Thinking: A Radical Approach to Saving the UniversityHigher education occupies a difficult place in twenty-first-century American culture. Universitiesâ€” the institutions that bear so much responsibility for the future health of our nationâ€” are at odds with the very publics they are intended to serve. As Kathleen Fitzpatrick asserts, it is imperative that we re-center the mission of the university to rebuild that lost trust. In Generous Thinking, Fitzpatrick roots this crisis in the work of scholars. Critical thinkingâ€” the heart of what academics doâ€” can today often negate, refuse, and reject new ideas. In an age characterized by rampant anti-intellectualism, Fitzpatrick charges the academy with thinking constructively rather than competitively, building new ideas rather than tearing old ones down. She urges us to rethink how we teach the humanities and to refocus our attention on the very human endsâ€” the desire for community and connectionâ€” that the humanities can best serve. One key aspect of that transformation involves fostering an atmosphere of what Fitzpatrick dubs"" generous thinking,"" a mode of engagement that emphasizes listening over speaking, community over individualism, and collaboration over competition. Fitzpatrick proposes ways that anyone who cares about the future of higher education can work to build better relationships between our colleges and universities and the public, thereby transforming the way our society functions. She encourages interested stakeholders to listen to and engage openly with one anothers concerns by reading and exploring ideas together; by creating collective projects focused around common interests; and by ensuring that our institutions of higher …","radical approach, new ideas, twentyfirstcentury american culture, kathleen fitzpatrick, future health, generous thinking, universityhigher education"
"GENERATING CRITICAL TRANSCRIPTIONS IN DIGITAL EDITIONS USING CHARACTER-LEVEL MACHINE TRANSLATIONHistoric manuscripts are often represented in the form of two transcriptions, a diplomatic and a critical one. The former follows closely the original while the latter interprets it, also by partly modernising its text. Generating a critical transcription is a time-consuming process, which could be improved through automatic methods. The paper presents a tool that uses character-based statistical machine translation, translating each line of the diplomatic transcription into the critical one. The method has been tested on two sermons (1825, 1829) by AM SlomšeB, and compared to several other approaches to text modernisation. The experiments show that training a program on the first sermon and testing it on the second one reduces the character error rate by nearly two thirds, performing better than other methods.Technological advances within the realm of language-oriented IT have had a significant impact on numerous aspects of digital humanities. In the field of textual criticism, digitization of texts has brought new possibilities for presentation, exploration and visual representation, prompting a paradigm shift toward great attention to the possible ways of presenting and bringing the text closer to its readers or, more widely, users.","machine translationhistoric, statistical machine translation, transcriptions, timeconsuming process, automatic methods, digital editions, text modernisation, characterlevel"
"Understanding the History of the Humanities from a Bibliometric Perspective: Expansion, Conjunctures, and Traditions in the Last Decades of Venetian Historiography (1950–2013)Historiography is undergoing incessant expansion in the number of publications and active scholars, as is the case with the humanities and sciences in general. Little is known about what effects this has on the research activity and ways of publishing of historians, often stemming from long-established practices. Yet it seems recurrent that during and after periods of sustained growth, several historians lament the increasingly specialized and narrow focus of their domain. This article considers three journals that specialize in the history of Venice but that represent different scholarly traditions. These are analyzed over the most recent decades of modern historiography (1950–2013). Special attention is given to the use of evidence, as mapped by citations to primary sources. It is shown that at least three trends overlap: the sustained expansion in the number of publications and active scholars; the persisting editorial …","incessant expansion, venetian historiography, active scholars, humanities, bibliometric perspective, historians, history, traditions, longestablished practices"

"Covert Online Ethnography and Machine Learning for Detecting Individuals at Risk of Being Drawn into Online Sex WorkHow can we identify individuals at risk of being drawn into online sex work? The spread of online communication removes transaction costs and enables a greater number of people to be involved in illicit activities, including online sex trade. As a result, social media platforms often work as springboard for criminal careers posing a significant risk to the economy, public health and trust. Detecting deviant behaviors online is limited by the poor availability of ground-truth data and machine learning tools. Unlike prior work which focuses exclusively on either qualitative or quantitative methods, in this paper we combine covert online ethnography with semi-supervised learning methodologies, using data from a popular European adult forum. We obtained risk assessment results of 78 users using covert online ethnography, and set out to build a machine learning model that can predict the risk factor in other 28,832 users …","popular european adult forum, online sex, machine learning tools, semisupervised learning methodologies, machine learning, covert online ethnography"

"VICOGLOSSIA: Annotatable and Commentable Library as a Bridge between Reader and Scholar (a proof of concept study: Early Soviet Philological Culture)How can we study, present and teach complex cultural phenomena such as the Russian philological culture of the 1920s? To achieve this goal, we elaborated a knowledge representation that facilitates scientific collaboration, enables distant reading, improves the navigation of scholarly literature, links classical texts to rich international scholarship, and provides a basis of effective visualization. Digital Humanities offer an ideal framework for the intense human-computer collaboration required to carry out such a project. We focus on the network of relations both within and between three key communities of the early Soviet philological milieu–the Formalists, the Marrists and the Bakhtinists–approaching them through the optics of two major philological romans à clef of the period. To this end, we (1) prepared a collection of primary texts;(2) built a repository of secondary literature;(3) using this research literature, enriched primary texts with both general and ad locum annotations;(4) adapted the nano-publications method as a comprehensive approach for representing this scholarly knowledge in the Semantic Web. We make use of the quantitative methods toolkit of the VicoGlossia system, which was developed as part of an international and inter-institutional collaboration.","scientific collaboration, scholarly literature, russian philological culture, commentable library, vicoglossia, rich international scholarship"

This work reports on an investigation into these questions, which we answer through analyses exploring metrics, machine learning classifiers, and recommendations. We report on several findings: the degree of expertise correlates to behavioral patterns, whereby experts would rarely ask for help, and instead, predominantly provide help to other community members; the inclusion of an expert results in longer discussions.

"How North Korea Views China: Quantitative Analysis of Korean Central News Agency ReportsHow does the North Korean government view China? This study examines North Korea’s foreign policy on China by analyzing the strategic options of North Korean leaders and applying sentiment analysis to Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reports about China. It is found that North Korea’s generally positive attitude toward China contains nuanced types of sentiments and that North Korean leaders have managed the expression of these sentiments in the media to achieve political goals at domestic and international levels. Our findings also suggest that, first, China may not be the key to the solution of the Korean nuclear issue. Second, Kim Jong Un was not a weak leader from the beginning of his rule. Rather he had acquired a substantial amount of authority before Kim Jong Il passed away. Based on our findings, an analysis of the future development of the North Korea–China relationship is also provided.","sentiment analysis, foreign policy, reportshow, north korea views china, strategic options, quantitative analysis, north korean leaders, north korea, korean central news agency"
"A Capsule Aesthetic: Feminist Materialisms in New Media ArtHow new media art informed by feminism yields important and original insights about interacting with technologies In A Capsule Aesthetic, Kate Mondloch examines how new media installation art intervenes in the fields of technoscience and new materialism, showing how three diverse artists—Pipilotti Rist, Patricia Piccinini, and Mariko Mori—contribute to the urgent conversation about everyday technology and the ways it constructs our bodies. A Capsule Aesthetic establishes the unique insights that feminist theory offers to new media art and new materialisms, offering a fuller picture of human–nonhuman relations. In-depth readings of works by Rist, Piccinini, and Mori explore such questions as the role of the contemporary art museum in our experience of media art, how the human is conceived of by biotechnologies, and how installation art can complicate and enrich contemporary science’s understanding of the brain. With vivid, firsthand descriptions of the artworks, Mondloch takes the reader inside immersive installation pieces, showing how they allow us to inhabit challenging theoretical concepts and nonanthropomorphic perspectives. Striving to think beyond the anthropocentric and fully consider the material world, A Capsule Aesthetic brings new approaches to questions surrounding our technology-saturated culture and its proliferation of human-to-nonhuman interfaces.","new materialism, installation, feminist materialisms, installation art, pipilotti rist, kate mondloch, new media art, media art, new media, original insights, capsule aesthetic"

"Automated comparison of children’s and adult songs supports the vocal mistuning theory of scale originsHuman music uses diverse scales, but there are some commonalities shared throughout much of the world’s scales. The “vocal mistuning” hypothesis proposes that cross-cultural regularities in musical scales arise from imprecision in vocal tuning. In order to test this hypothesis, we conducted automatic comparative analysis of 70 matched children’s and adult songs from 35 areas around the world. We found that children’s songs tend to have fewer scale degrees than adults and narrower melodic ranges than adult songs, consistent with motor limitations due to their earlier developmental stage. These results suggest that some universal aspects of musical scales may be caused by motor constraints rather than evolutionary adaptations for music perception.","adult songs, musical scales, children, diverse scales, automated comparison"
"Cloud Resource Optimization for Processing Multiple Streams of Visual DataHundreds of millions of network cameras have been installed throughout the world. Each is capable of providing a vast amount of real-time data. Analyzing the massive data generated by these cameras requires significant computational resources and the demands may vary over time. Cloud computing shows the most promise to provide the needed resources on demand. In this article, we investigate how to allocate cloud resources when analyzing real-time data streams from network cameras. A resource manager considers many factors that affect its decisions, including the types of analysis, the number of data streams, and the locations of the cameras. The manager then selects the most cost-efficient types of cloud instances (e.g. CPU vs. GPGPU) to meet the computational demands for analyzing streams. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using Amazon Web Services.

"TURNING PRACTICE INSIDE OUTI have argued elsewhere (Jones 2014) that a new digital humanities emerged around 2004–2008 in response to changes in technology and how digital networks were perceived—what author William Gibson has called the eversion of cyberspace. Gibson coined the term cyberspace in a 1982 short story, but it became famous in his 1984 cyberpunk novel, Neuromancer, where it was the name for an online realm that was an abstract, disembodied nonspace, above and beyond the physical world, a kind of wireframe landscape familiar in movies such as Tron, for example. Through the 1980s and 1990s, popular notions of the internet—widespread access to which was only just emerging—were dominated by the metaphor of cyberspace. It was where people went when they went online.But starting about 2007, Gibson overwrote his own earlier metaphor:“Cyberspace, not so long ago, was a specific elsewhere, one we visited periodically, peering into it from the familiar physical world. Now cyberspace has everted. Turned itself inside out. Colonized the physical”(Gibson 2010). To “evert” is to turn inside out—as when an umbrella flips upward in a rainstorm, exposing its carrier to the weather. That image of exposure, the sense of being inside the network, of soaking in it, is what the eversion feels like. The digital network, with its connected data, is now recognized as being down here, in the world all around us.","outi, digital networks, new digital humanities, practice, physical world, gibson"
"Second language writing online: An updateI last wrote an overview of developments in second language (L2) online writing 10 years ago (Godwin-Jones, 2008). Since that time, there have been significant developments in this area. There has been renewed interest in L2 writing through the wide use of social media, along with the rising popularity of computer-mediated communication (CMC) and telecollaboration (class-based online exchanges). The recognition of writing as a social act has also led to a significant rise in interest in collaborative writing. This has been aided by the popularity of tools providing a shared writing space, such as Google Docs. The importance and recognition of genre in both student work and writing theory have grown considerably among practitioners and researchers. The increased practice of integrating multimedia into writing is reflected in the popularity of multimodal projects, such as digital storytelling. At the same time, digital tools for evaluating writing have become more widely available in the form of digital annotators and automated writing evaluation (AWE) software, which take advantage of advances in corpus linguistics and natural language processing (NLP). In addition, tools for processing and evaluating large data sets enable approaches from data mining that provide valuable insights into writing processes. The variety and, in some cases, the complexity of online writing environments has increased the need for both learner and teacher training.","online writing, social media, language writing online, developments, social act, digital, l2 writing, significant developments, natural language processing"

"PRIMITIVE CRITICISM AND THE NOVEL: GH LEWES AND HIPPOLYTE TAINE ON DICKENSIN A CONTROVERSIAL ARTICLE ON the life and fiction of Charles Dickens, George H. Lewes ponders the inexplicable preference of readers for the novelist’s too-simplistic characters over the more complex characters of other writers. He finds an answer in the primitive reaction to fine art:“To a savage there is so little suggestion of a human face and form in a painted portrait that it is not even recognized as the representation of a man”(“Dickens” 150). The implication, it would seem, is that readers turn to Dickens because they are similarly incapable of appreciating more refined modes of art. Today the remark reads as gratuitous and insulting to readers, to Dickens, and to the other cultures Lewes stereotypes as savage.

"THE TERM ‘OLD SPORT’IN THE GREAT GATSBY (1925)IT is a strangely unexamined assumption of literary criticism that Jay Gatsby’s habitual expression ‘old sport’must be a residue of his time at Oxford University. Since F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel, The Great Gatsby, first appeared in 1925, Gatsby’s catchphrase has won the attention of many critics, but only in passing, and nearly always under the belief that the expression is English. For example, Gordon Slethaug recently remarked that ‘Gatsby affects the term ‘‘old sport’’to sound as if he is from an Old English family and Oxford background, thereby perpetuating a lie about himself, his ethnicity, and his origins.’1 And the novelist Haruki Murakami writes, in an essay on translating Fitzgerald’s novel,‘Old sport’was probably a British expression around that time, somewhat similar to ‘old chap’today.

"Now you see them: Self-representation and the refugee selfieImages of Syrian refugees taking selfies have circulated throughout the news media, yielding a range of responses, from dismay to disgust. An exploration of postcolonial digital humanities methods, this article brings together quantitative textual analysis of news media articles from the United States and United Kingdom, postcolonial theory, and selfie scholarship to explore the representation of Syrian refugees in the news media and their self-representation in selfies. Examining “migrant-related selfies” theorized in scholarship on migrant media, I argue that photographs of refugees taking selfies are being marshaled by news media to complement reporting on immigration anxieties within the Global North. On the other hand, “refugee selfies,” the images refugees themselves are taking, avoid co-optation into such narratives.

"Miley, What’s Good?: Nicki Minaj’s Anaconda, Instagram Reproductions, and Viral Memetic ViolenceImages on popular social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter that are the most entertaining are loaded with memetic power because their value is based on cultural attitudes that already constitute our lives in the everyday. Focusing on memes appropriating the artwork from Nicki Minaj’s single, Anaconda, I explore how popular memetic culture is fueled by Black women’s creativity yet positions Black women’s bodies as the fodder for potent viral images on social media platforms and in everyday experiences; Black girlhoods, at this level of representation and in lived experiences, are rarely awarded the distinction from womanhood that many other girlhoods enjoy.

"Flexible Learning-Free Segmentation and Reconstruction of Neural VolumesImaging is a dominant strategy for data collection in neuroscience, yielding stacks of images that often scale to gigabytes of data for a single experiment. Machine learning algorithms from computer vision can serve as a pair of virtual eyes that tirelessly processes these images, automatically detecting and identifying microstructures. Unlike learning methods, our Flexible Learning-free Reconstruction of Imaged Neural volumes (FLoRIN) pipeline exploits structure-specific contextual clues and requires no training. This approach generalizes across different modalities, including serially-sectioned scanning electron microscopy (sSEM) of genetically labeled and contrast enhanced processes, spectral confocal reflectance (SCoRe) microscopy, and high-energy synchrotron X-ray microtomography (μCT) of large tissue volumes.

"Austrian Transition to Open Access (AT2OA)In 2016 the expert group called “Open Access Network Austria” (OANA) published 16 recommendations on how Austria should support a transition to open access (OA). The overarching recommendation is that “By 2025, a large part of all scholarly publication activity in Austria should be Open Access. In other words, the final versions of most scholarly publications (in particular all refereed journal articles and conference proceedings) resulting from the support of public resources must be freely accessible on the Internet without delay (Gold Open Access).”   These recommendations generated discussions across the sector and questions were raised over costs. In order to address these questions and to explore wider implications, the Austrian university libraries submitted a joint application to the Ministry of Science, Research & Economics and managed to secure funding for a project entitled “Austrian Transition to Open Access” (AT2OA).   The goal of the AT2OA project, launched in 2017, is to support the large-scale transformation of scholarly publications from Closed to OA, and to implement measures supporting this initiative. The project aims to increase Austria’s OA publication output by restructuring license agreements with publishers and by providing targeted support for researchers’ publication activities. It will also establish new venues for OA publishing.   Currently there are seven transition agreements (see https://konsortien.at/openaccess-en.asp) in place within the framework of the Austrian Academic Library Consortium (KEMÖ).   During the talk we will discuss lessons learned and present the first results of our analyses.","austria, publication, open access, austrian transition, access, expert group"
"Gaming Masculinity: Trolls, Fake Geeks, and the Gendered Battle for Online CultureIn 2016, a female videogame programmer and a female journalist were harassed viciously by anonymous male online users in what became known as GamerGate. Male gamers threatened to rape and kill both women, and the news soon made international headlines, exposing the level of abuse that many women and minorities face when participating in the predominantly male online culture. Gaming Masculinity explains how the term “gamer” has been constructed in the popular imagination by a core group of male online users in an attempt to shore up an embattled form of geeky masculinity. This latest form of toxicity comes at a moment of upheaval in gaming culture, as women, people of color, and LGBTQ individuals demand broader access and representation online. Paying close attention to the online practices of trolling and making memes, author Megan Condis demonstrates that, despite the supposedly disembodied nature of life online, performances of masculinity are still afforded privileged status in gamer culture. Even worse, she finds that these competing discourses are not just relegated to the gaming world but are creating rifts within the culture at large, as witnessed by the direct links between the GamerGate movement and the recent rise of the alt-right during the last presidential election. Condis asks what this moment can teach us about the performative, collaborative, and sometimes combative ways that American culture enacts race, gender, and sexuality. She concludes by encouraging designers and those who work in the tech industry to think about how their work might have, purposefully or not, been developed in ways that …","gendered battle, gaming masculinity, female videogame programmer, online culturein, fake geeks, male online, male gamers, female journalist"
"Between Innovation and Conservation: The Narrow Path of User Interface Design for Digital Scholarly EditionsIn 2016, the Edition Visualization Technology (EVT: evt. labcd. unipi. it/) team started the design phase necessary for the development of the next version of this tool aimed at easy publishing of TEIXML-based digital editions: the current version (EVT 1.2), in fact, only supports diplomatic transcriptions linked to the corresponding manuscript images; EVT 2.0 will fully support critical editions encoded according to the TEI parallel segmentation method. To reach this goal, a completely new approach based on the AngularJS framework and the MVC (Model View Controller) architectural pattern was necessary because the old architecture, relying on XSLT 2.0 transformations, was no longer flexible enough to meet all the UI and navigation requirements of critical editions. Furthermore, during the design phase we decided that in some cases keeping a layout inspired by traditional printed editions would be a great help for our final users. After a long but interesting development process, a beta version of EVT 2 is out: we believe that the UI layout and solutions we devised are both effective in the short term, for all the projects that will adopt EVT, and a significant contribution to the theoretical discussion revolving around the very concept of DSE.","design phase, innovation, edition visualization technology, critical editions, development, interface design, conservation, easy publishing, model view controller, narrow path, digital scholarly editionsin"

"A ‘natural experiment’in Australian cultural policy: Australian Government funding cuts disproportionately affect companies that produce more new work and have larger audiencesIn Australia, cultural policy settings differentiate between purported ‘small-to-medium’ and ‘major’ performing arts organisations, primarily in relation to their revenue size and institutional stability. This article publishes a quantitative analysis of the relative creative outputs of these Australian performing arts organisations, focusing primarily on the production of so-called ‘new works’: original cultural texts, created and performed recently. Using survey data from 21 Australian performing arts organisations, as well as aggregated government data regarding 173 performing arts organisations, and repertoire data for 8 symphony orchestras, across 7 years, we set out to determine the relationship (if any) of organisational scale and artform to the amount of new work in the Australian publicly subsidised performing arts sector.

"The Triumph of Proximity: The Impact of District Nursing Schemes in 1890s’ Rural IrelandIn February 1900, Father John P. Connelly, the Roman Catholic parish priest of Achill Island, County Mayo, wrote to the Queen Victoria’s Jubilee Institute for Nurses in Dublin, pleading for funds to retain the island’s Jubilee nurse. Emotively, he claimed that the year before she arrived, there had been 24 maternal deaths and “scarcely any since she came here.” 1 Irvine Loudon has advocated both broad and micro approaches to the study of maternal mortality to problematize official statistics. 2 In this article, I present a micro-study of Achill Island, which provides a good example of a community that availed of a diverse “medical marketplace” and used modern, patent, and traditional medicine alike. 3 The aims are to provide insight into the complicated patient–practitioner relationship and the impact district nursing made on maternal health in rural Ireland.

"Changes to the genetic evaluation of fertility in Irish dairy cattleIn Ireland, the current genetic evaluation of dairy cattle includes a joint fertility and survival module. It is a multiple trait animal model combining 23 traits. Calving interval is utilized as the primary fertility trait, and this aligns with the definition used in many countries with predominantly all year-round calving systems. It is also widely accepted within the scientific community as providing an accurate measure of genetic merit for fertility. However, around half of the herds in Ireland display seasonal calving patterns, with this trend steadily increasing, and is actively promoted by advocates for a low-cost industry. Calving interval has been found to be an inappropriate selection criterion for fertility in seasonal systems, as early calving and likely more fertile cows often have very long calving intervals, because they are withheld from mating, to avoid them calving too early in the following calving season. The aim of this work was to assess the feasibility and benefits of defining more seasonally orientated phenotypes for the genetic evaluation of fertility for those herds that are classed as seasonal calving. The results from the following steps of work are presented. Firstly, it was necessary to develop a robust set of criteria to differentiate seasonal from non-seasonal herds. This was complicated by the fact that many herds are dynamic across years in the extent to which they restrict calvings to within a season. The approach taken in this study treats a non-seasonal classification as the default for any cow fertility record. Fertility records were classified into the seasonal category if the animal’s contemporary group met certain seasonality criteria. Secondly, the …","joint fertility, genetic merit, genetic evaluation, herds, irish dairy cattlein ireland, seasonal calving, multiple trait animal model, calving interval"
"Bibliographical Distortions, Distortive Habits: Contextualizing Italian Publications in the History of ScienceIn Italy, many works devoted to the history of science are published traditionally in philosophy journals. Also, a surprisingly large amount of brilliant, rigorous, and innovative research comes from publications that are deemed marginal—or are not considered at all—by the milieu of Italian academia. Why is this so, and how has it come about? There is, I confess, an autobiographical strand in this note: for Italy is where I took my first steps as a scholar and, to a large extent, I have been intellectually and professionally shaped by this environment. And yet, it took Stephen Weldon’s invitation to serve as his bibliographic adviser in matters Italian for me to even begin to notice how different Italy’s publication politics are from those commonly found in other countries, especially in the English-speaking world.

"Using external identifiers to improve Wikidata and its related datasets: state of play and future workIn Wikidata, each entity can be linked to an external database using a specific"" externalId"" property. For example, the English writer Douglas Adams (Q42) is linked to some 80 databases that have a record about him, such as the French national library (BnF), the Library of Congress (LoC) or the Internet Movie Database (IMDb).With about 3500 different externalId (December 2018), and as many linked databases, Wikidata is potentially one of the most important hubs of outgoing links. We believe that these links can be leveraged to improve several data quality dimensions 1 of Wikidata. Indeed, one or more of the 80 external databases mentioned in our example above may have information about Douglas Adams that is not yet mentioned on his Wikidatas page, such as his possible pseudonyms (property P742). They could also be used to add references to statements such as"" employer (P108): BBC (Q9531). However, we also believe that, through a feedback process, these links can also improve the quality of the external databases, in particular by identifying duplicates.

This verification process can also help to ensure that the entities described in the external databases refer to the same reality as that described in Wikidata. In other words, that the two entities can be linked by a strong identity like owl: sameAs.

"Something Ill in the Air: Ruskins Storm Cloudand Nicholsons WindscaleIn a previous issue of Comet, I attempted to trace a few connections between the lives and works of Norman Nicholson and John Ruskin. Both men, as I suggested, were possessed by similar passions, and both were, moreover, guided by compatible philosophical outlooks. Both Nicholson and Ruskin were, for instance, deeply influenced by their love of geology, and for both men this love was inspired by a sensitivity to natural beauty and by an ability to perceive universal processes at work in the most ordinary rocks and minerals. Such mutual loves notwithstanding, Nicholson was certainly capable of criticising Ruskin’s ideas, and he was particularly scathing about Ruskin’s engagement with the natural sciences. One need only turn to the eleventh chapter of The Lakers for proof. Here, Nicholson is complementary about Ruskin’s powers of observation, but he is dismissive–if not derisive–about the scientific dimensions of Ruskin’s thought. Nicholson’s beef, briefly summarised, is that the ostensibly scientific character of Ruskin’s thinking is belied by his commitment to an aesthetic and moral point of view.‘Ruskin’, writes Nicholson,‘studied science as an artist studies anatomy’: in order ‘to learn how to look’at the world and to distil lessons from what he saw. 1 Ruskin’s ability to draw valid deductions from the study of natural phenomena was, Nicholson implies, consequently impaired.A key point of contention for Nicholson, in this specific respect, are the claims about the ‘plague-wind’that Ruskin advanced in the two lectures he delivered at the London Institution on 4 and 11 February 1884. These lectures, later published as The Storm-Cloud of the …","natural beauty, nicholson, john ruskin, norman nicholson"

"The Editor in the Interface: Guiding the User through Texts and ImagesIn a way, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) can be regarded as the digital scholarly edition’s new paratext: not exactly part of the edited text itself, it still has an undeniable impact on the way the user reads and understands the edition. This makes the interface an important place for the editor to convey her views on the materials the edition has to offer. Therefore, this paper focusses on the role the editor of the digital scholarly edition plays in guiding the user through its data, and helping her shape her interpretation of those data–arguing all the while that it is exactly in the interface that these interactions take place. Starting from Mats Dahlström’s proposal for digital scholarly editors to leave Ariadne threads to guide their users through the textual labyrinth of their digital scholarly editions, this paper suggests that Dante’s Divine Comedy might make a more appropriate allegory for the editorial model. Taking a cue from Dante’s ‘Virgil’character, the editor may prefer to remain in the background of the edition, encouraging the user to be fully immersed in the edition’s data–only to quietly step more and more in the foreground as the user moves deeper and deeper into the edition and could arguably use more explicit guidance. After taking a more theoretical approach to this topic, the paper illustrates the kind of editorial decisions that may be involved while designing a digital scholarly edition by taking the Beckett Digital Manuscript Project (BDMP) as a case study. Walking the reader through the many tools and functionalities the BDMP has to offer, this paper explains how this editorial model would apply to the project, focusing especially on the changes …","edition, beckett digital manuscript project, user, interface"
"Orchestrating overviews: A synoptic approach to the visualization of cultural collectionsIn addition to providing pleasant and stimulating experiences, complex cultural collections can require significant amounts of cognitive work on the part of visitors. Whether collections are situated in physical spaces or presented via web-based interfaces, the sheer richness and diversity of artefacts and their associated information can frequently lead to cognitive overload and fatigue. In this article we explore visualization methods that can be used to fend off fatigue and to support cognitive tasks such as collection exploration and conceptual comprehension. We discuss a variety of options to generate collection representations with multiple views and focus on the rarely heeded challenge of how to integrate information from these views into a bigger picture. By utilizing multiple space-time cube representations (through the PolyCube framework), we discuss an effective approach to integrating and mediating multiple perspectives on cultural collection data. We illustrate its potential by the means of a case study on the work of Charles W. Cushman and outline first insights drawn from a heuristic evaluation. Finally, we situate our approach within the larger epistemic and methodological environment of humanities approaches to visualization design.","complex cultural collections, collection representations, stimulating experiences, orchestrating overviews, synoptic approach, cultural collectionsin addition, visualization, cognitive, multiple"

In these watersheds, a comprehensive approach to reducing channel erosion can aid in the feasibility of meeting water quality goals. In the Minnesota River Basin (MRB), a large agricultural watershed, increased peak flows have contributed to greater sediment loading from within the channel. This study focuses on three components of channel restoration that are important in developing a strategic framework: sediment source reduction, working with private landowners, and the economics of restoration. A synthesis of sediment research was done to assess the sediment reduction benefit of restoration projects.

The Internet pushed through these limits; from web pages to video sharing sites to podcasts, Internet-related technologies increased information speed, volume, diversity, audience, and many other facets. In particular, the significant increase of online and distributed classroom environments brings new technological challenges. The next decade will likely continue this shift from traditional university classrooms to online offerings. This change requires new technologies and learning systems to bring students together in new ways, improve collaboration in distributed settings, and support learning in new, improved ways.In this minitrack, we explore this changing landscape with research into learning technologies, their application, and their impact on all of us. Papers were solicited on learning theories, cognition, tools and their development, enabling platforms, communication media, distance learning, supporting infrastructures, user experiences, research methods, social impacts, and/or measurable outcomes as they relate to the area of technology and its support of improving teaching and learning.","minitrack, distance learning, information age"
"Scientific investigations of the I mperial G ates from the P etrindu wooden church, S alaj C ounty, R omaniaIn order to preserve and restore the Imperial Gates from the Petrindu wooden church, Salaj County, Romania, (map location—latitude, longitude: 46.97, 23.19), the scientific investigation of the wooden support and painting materials (ground and pigments) was performed, employing Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X‐ray fluorescence spectroscopy, and 3D scanning. FTIR spectroscopy offered information about the wooden degradation stage, whereas X‐ray fluorescence and FTIR spectroscopic methods were employed for structural painting materials characterization. The structural data can be correlated with the artistic, theological, and historical analysis of this religious patrimony object. After obtaining information about the wooden support and painting materials, the Imperial Gates were 3D digitized using state of the art laser scanning technology.

"Willingness to produce perennial bioenergy crops: A contingent supply approachIn order to reduce economic and national security risks, U.S. energy policy, in 2005 and 2007, mandated production of renewable biofuels. By 2010, the renewable biofuel industry was consuming approximately one-third of domestic corn and soybean production. To meet this growing demand, conservation and pastureland has been cultivated with corn and soybean, resulting in a reduction in ecosystem services. Perennial bioenergy crops (e.g., switchgrass) offer a more sustainable alternative. However, unlike annual crops, farmers and landowners have little experience with perennial bioenergy crop production. Uncertainty in production and prices may impact the supply of these novel crops into an emerging market. Using a contingent supply method, we show that agricultural landowners are willing to produce perennial bioenergy crops, given competitive returns, but only on a portion of their land.","renewable biofuels, national security risks, bioenergy crops, willingness, contingent supply, production"
"Serendipity in context: Prioritised contextual browsing in large-scale digital librariesIn previous work we proposed a model of information-seeking behaviour in scholarly workset creation, combining and extend-ing established models by Bates, Ellis, and Wilson to encompass strategies for scholarly research in large-scale information systems. However, this model simplifies contextual browsing, a key aspect of information seeking in large-scale information systems, as a single, holistic, strategy. Here, we extend this model with granular strategies for contextual browsing, defining new modes to characterise contextual browsing as combinations of these strategies, which we show to be consistent with ser-endipitous discovery as described by Makri et al. We study the properties of prioritised contextual browsing as a mechanism for implementing these strategies. We describe the Compage framework, a proof-of-concept implementation for prioritised contextual browsing of Linked Data resources, using Jaccard similarity for prioritisation. Extending Compage, we develop a simulation environment in which we investigate the utility of prioritised contextual browsing over a large-scale digital library dataset. Our simulation applies three strategies for the traversal of contextual metadata: reset, unprioritised, and prioritised. Results empirically demonstrate the advantages of prioritised contextual browsing, and that elements of serendipity can be identified and incorporated within our information-seeking model. In doing so, we evaluate our models suitability for this scenario, yielding a more detailed understanding of the strategies and modes of behaviour underlying contextual browsing.","granular strategies, scholarly workset creation, contextual browsing, serendipity, strategies, model, largescale information systems"
"Collections as data: Implications for enclosureIn recent years a growing amount of interest has been dedicated to collections as data. A collections as data paradigm seeks to foster an expanded set of research, pedagogical, and artistic potential predicated on the computational use of cultural heritage collections. Collections as data raises the question of what it might mean to treat digitized and born digital collections as data rather than simple surrogates of physical objects or static representations of digital experience.","artistic potential, implications, static representations, data paradigm, physical objects, digital collections, data, simple surrogates"
"dhSegment: A generic deep-learning approach for document segmentationIn recent years there have been multiple successful attempts tackling document processing problems separately by designing task specific hand-tuned strategies. We argue that the diversity of historical document processing tasks prohibits to solve them one at a time and shows a need for designing generic approaches in order to handle the variability of historical series. In this paper, we address multiple tasks simultaneously such as page extraction, baseline extraction, layout analysis or multiple typologies of illustrations and photograph extraction. We propose an open-source implementation of a CNN-based pixel-wise predictor coupled with task dependent post-processing blocks. We show that a single CNN-architecture can be used across tasks with competitive results. Moreover most of the task-specific post-precessing steps can be decomposed in a small number of simple and standard reusable operations, adding to the flexibility of our approach.","dhsegment, historical series, baseline extraction, generic deeplearning approach, document, document processing, multiple successful attempts, generic approaches, multiple typologies"
"Event Detection and Classification for the Digital HumanitiesIn recent years, event processing has become an active area of research in the Natural Language Processing community but resources and automatic systems developed so far have mainly addressed contemporary texts. However, the recognition and elaboration of events is a crucial step when dealing with historical texts: research in this domain can lead to the development of methodologies and tools that can assist historians in enhancing their work and can have an impact both in the fields of Natural Language Processing and Digital Humanities. Our work aims at shedding light on the complex concept of events adopting an interdisciplinary perspective. More specifically, theoretical and practical investigations are carried out on the specific topic of event detection and classification in historical texts by developing and releasing new annotation guidelines, new resources and new models for automatic annotation.","digital, event detection, historical texts, active area, contemporary texts"
"‘Making such bargain’: Transcribe Bentham and the quality and cost-effectiveness of crowdsourced transcriptionIn recent years, important research on crowdsourcing in the cultural heritage sector has been published, dealing with topics such as the quantity of contributions made by volunteers, the motivations of those who participate in such projects, the design and establishment of crowdsourcing initiatives, and their public engagement value. This article addresses a gap in the literature, and seeks to answer two key questions in relation to crowdsourced transcription:(1) whether volunteers’ contributions are of a high enough standard for creating a publicly accessible database, and for use in scholarly research; and (2) if crowdsourced transcription makes economic sense, and if the investment in launching and running such a project can ever pay off. In doing so, this article takes the award-winning crowdsourced transcription initiative, Transcribe Bentham, which began in 2010, as its case study.

"LabelTransfer-Integrating Static and Dynamic Label Representation for Focus+ Context Text ExplorationIn recent years, interactive visualization to analyze text documents has gained an impressive momentum. This is not surprising considering the fast increase of electronically available textual documents of various kinds. These include, for example, patents, scholarly documents, social media messages, and many other sources that contain valuable knowledge and insights for many stakeholders. Interactive text visualization turned out to be an important means for exploring and gaining insights into complex and often large document collections. An established visualization strategy to represent such collections is using projection-based techniques that visualize documents as glyphs in a 2D view aiming to reflect the semantic similarity of documents by the proximity of their placement.

"Reading Very Well for Our Age: Hyperobject Metadata and Global Warming in Emily St John Mandels Station ElevenIn recent years, the practices of symptomatic reading have been called into question by scholars such as Stephen Best, Sharon Marcus, Cathy N. Davidson, David Theo Goldberg, Rita Felski and Bruno Latour. It is claimed that such readings have become either formulaic or politically inefficacious. This article argues, against such thinking, that Emily St. John Mandels Arthur C. Clarke-award winning novel, Station Eleven 2014, presents several challenges for an age of so-called post-critical reading. A novel that is, in some ways, about how the future will “read” our present, I here use the metaphor of ""metadata"" to think through the series of ruined objects that project a hyper-object like extent across the two epistemic contexts in Station Eleven. I argue that this is a comment on interpretative reading practices and an invitation to politicised symptomatic readings of the novel. Using this approach, I show that Station Eleven is a novel that is deeply concerned with global warming and with colonial nationalist legacies, even while such concerns appear buried – or even absent – within the novel. However, if one takes the novel’s surface instruction to look for “another world just out sight”, these concerns of the early-twenty-first century emerge as central to the forking futures of Mandel’s work.","global warming, hyperobject metadata, symptomatic reading, emily st john mandel, station elevenin, station eleven"
"Decolonizing Digital Humanities in Theory and PracticeIn recent years, the question of what it means to “decolonize” digital humanities has been broached by scholars engaged in both postcolonial digital humanities and# TransformDH, strands of the field that have pushed for greater attention to digital humanities projects and methods that foreground intersectional engagement with race, gender, class, sexuality, nation, disability, and other axes of identity that shape knowledge production. Such approaches to digital humanities have asked how to decolonize the archive (Povinelli 2011; Lothian & Phillips 2013; Cushman 2013; cárdenas et al. 2015; Risam 2015), address gaps in knowledge produced online (Lor and Britz 2005; Sheppard 2005; Koh & Risam 2013), make legible narratives and histories that have gone untold (Rawson 2014; Thorat 2015; Verhoeven 2015), understand the specificities of digital Dalit experience (Nayar 2011), locate the subaltern in …","theory, knowledge, digital humanities"
"Review of Planetary Protection Policy Development ProcessIn response to a request from NASA, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has conducted a study to review the current state of the planetary protection policy development process. The study addresses two key questions. First, is the US and international policy-making process responsive to the present state of science, technology, and engineering? Second, can the current policy-development process be extended to encompass the commercial and exploration interests of state and non-state actors?

"Justify your alphaIn response to recommendations to redefine statistical significance to P≤ 0.005, we propose that researchers should transparently report and justify all choices they make when designing a study, including the alpha level.Benjamin et al. 1 proposed changing the conventional “statistical significance” threshold (that is, the alpha level) from P≤ 0.05 to P≤ 0.005 for all novel claims with relatively low prior odds. They provided two arguments for why lowering the significance threshold would “immediately improve the reproducibility of scientific research”. First, a P value near 0.05 provides weak evidence for the alternative hypothesis. Second, under certain assumptions, an alpha level of 0.05 leads to high false positive report probabilities (FPRPs 2; the probability that a significant finding is a false positive).","significance threshold, scientific research, alternative hypothesis, statistical significance, low prior odds, threshold, alphain, weak evidence, recommendations"
"The tropical-subtropical coupling in the Southeast Atlantic from the perspective of the northern Benguela upwelling systemIn the Benguela upwelling system, the environmental conditions are determined to a large extent by central water masses advected from remote areas onto the shelf. The origin, spreading pathways and fate of those water masses are investigated with a regional ocean model that is analysed using Eulerian passive tracers and on the basis of Lagrangian trajectories. Two major water masses influencing the Benguela upwelling system are identified: tropical South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) and subtropical Eastern South Atlantic Central Water (ESACW). The spreading of tropical waters into the subtropical Benguela upwelling system is mediated by equatorial currents and their continuation in the Southeast Atlantic. This tropical-subtropical connection has been attributed to signal propagation in the equatorial and coastal waveguides. However, there exists an additional spreading path for tropical central water in the open ocean. This mass transport fluctuates on a seasonal scale around an averaged meridional transport in Sverdrup balance. The inter-annual variability of the advection of tropical waters is related to Benguela Niños, as evidenced by the 2010/2011 event. The northern Benguela upwelling system is a transition zone between SACW and ESACW since they encounter each other at about 20°S. Both water masses have seasonal variable shares in the upwelled water there. To summarise the main pathways of central water mass transport, an enhanced scheme for the subsurface circulation in the Southeast Atlantic is presented.","central water, northern benguela, water masses, southeast atlantic, environmental conditions, benguela upwelling, tropicalsubtropical coupling"

"""To unpathd waters, undreamd shores: Shakespeare in the World."" The Score: An Insiders Guide to the Performing Arts (New York: Lincoln Center, June 28, 2018)In the centuries since William Shakespeares death, numerous stage and, more recently, film and television adaptations of his work have emerged to inspire, comfort, and provoke audiences in far-flung corners of the globe. As early as 1619, for example, Hamlet was performed in colonial Indonesia to entertain European expatriates. In 1845, US Army officers staged Othello in Corpus Christi, Texas, as a distraction from the run-up to the Mexican-American War. Supported by the National Endowment for the Arts, the Alabama Shakespeare Festival toured its production of Macbeth to several key US military bases in 2004. The gender roles have also been taken for a spin, notably in Phyllida Lloyds all-female production of Julius Caesar and Henry IV (Donmar Warehouse, London, 2012 and 2014). Set in a womens prison, the cross-gender performance stirred heated discussions. Meanwhile, rehearsing The Comedy of Errors in Kabul and eventually performingat the Globe Theatre in London during the 2012 Olympics helped the Roy-e-Sabs Company cope with persecution from the Talibans and take shelter from harsh Afghan politics.","globe, television adaptations, new york, numerous stage, production, farflung corners, william shakespeare, performing arts"
"NAHR: a visual representation of social networks as support for art history researchIn the field of art history, the analysis of community dynamics can give researchers precious insight on the subjects of their studies. Data on genealogy and community bonds can provide a rich understanding of the functioning of a community. Traditional family trees are not designed to support extra-familial links and often lack the time-bound aspect of these relationships, and timeline-style tools miss the mark on representing the network dimension of such structures. We introduce NAHR (Networks in Art History Research), a tool that visualizes small networks of families connected through marriage, god-parenthood and professional relationships, and that provides insight in the change of these dynamics over time.","art history, nahr, traditional family trees, visual representation, social networks, community dynamics, relationships"
"Reaping the benefits of digitisation: Pilot study exploring revenue generation from digitised collections through technological InnovationIn the last decade significant resources have been invested for the digitisation of the collections of a large number of museums and galleries worldwide. In Europe alone, 10 million EUR is annually invested in Europeana (Europeana 2014). However, as we gradually move on from “the start-up phase” of digitisation (Hughes 2004), revenue generation and sustainability must be considered (Hughes 2004). Even beyond digitisation, generating revenue through innovation and in particular “finding new business models to sustain funding” (Simon 2011) ranks amongst museums’ top challenges (Simon 2011). More importantly, despite the significant wealth of digitised assets museums now own, little has been done to investigate ways these institutions could financially benefit from their digitised collections.  For art institutions in particular, this has been largely limited to the sale of image licenses, with the fear of losing this revenue posing as one of the key reasons art museums are reluctant to join the Open Content movement (Kapsalis 2016). This paper examines how recent technological advancements, such as image recognition and Print-on-Demand automation, can be utilised to take advantage of the wealth of digitised artworks museums and galleries have in their possession. A pilot study of the proposed solution at the State Museum of Contemporary Art (SMCA) in Thessaloniki, Greece, is covered and the findings are examined.  Early feedback indicates that there is a significant potential in the utilisation of the aforementioned technologies for the monetisation of digitised collections.

"Getting the subtext without the text: Scalable multimodal sentiment classification from visual and acoustic modalitiesIn the last decade, video blogs (vlogs) have become an extremely popular method through which people express sentiment. The ubiquitousness of these videos has increased the importance of multimodal fusion models, which incorporate video and audio features with traditional text features for automatic sentiment detection. Multimodal fusion offers a unique opportunity to build models that learn from the full depth of expression available to human viewers. In the detection of sentiment in these videos, acoustic and video features provide clarity to otherwise ambiguous transcripts. In this paper, we present a multimodal fusion model that exclusively uses high-level video and audio features to analyze spoken sentences for sentiment. We discard traditional transcription features in order to minimize human intervention and to maximize the deployability of our model on at-scale real-world data. We select high-level features for our model that have been successful in nonaffect domains in order to test their generalizability in the sentiment detection domain. We train and test our model on the newly released CMU Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity (CMUMOSEI) dataset, obtaining an F1 score of 0.8049 on the validation set and an F1 score of 0.6325 on the held-out challenge test set.","multimodal fusion, scalable multimodal sentiment classification, sentiment detection, acoustic modalitiesin, video blogs, audio features"
"An Interactive Haptic System for Experiencing Traditional ArcheryIn the last decades, more and more virtual systems are used for various activities: training, explanation, simulation, or verifying different concepts. This paper presents a first attempt to create a CogInfoCom channel through which a Virtual Reality (VR) system communicates with a natural cognitive system (prototype and physical experimental system) in a way that improves human cognitive abilities to understand the way an ancient bow works and the sensations it exerts on the human body. This study proposes an immersive VR simulator for recreating the experience of shooting with 3 types of old bows, based on a customized haptic interface. The research focuses on optimizing the shooting experience by using the force characteristic measured from real replicas, as well as handling other important archery features such as the length of the draw or the weight of the bow. The results are mostly positive and the data collected demonstrates the adaptability and replicability of the developed solution, as the system is able to reproduce in VR any type of bow.","human cognitive abilities, human body, system, coginfocom channel, ancient bow works, haptic interface, immersive vr simulator, haptic system, virtual systems, experiencing traditional archeryin"
"The psychological constructs and dimensions applied to sports performance: a change of theoretical paradigmsIn the last twenty years, sports performance studies have focused on the mental abilities most developed in athletes and how they affect their performance. The theoretical models underlying the test Psychological Inventory of Sport Performance (IPPS-48) developed in 2009 focus, unlike previous instruments, on both positive and negative mental abilities that influence sports performance. Contemporary literature provides an articulated framework of mental abilities that strengthen, support or impede sporting performance. For example, it is referred to the self-efficacy, the definition of objectives, the control of thoughts, the simulation through the imagination that anticipates the competition, the management of the emotional arousal (stress, anxiety, etc.) and channeling the concentration on the performance, but also in negative we refer to concern and disturbances in concentration and attention. From a methodological point of view, a systematic review of the existing literature on both dimensions of mental abilities will be provided, examining both the negative effects on athletic performance of athletes and the strategies aimed at promoting positive effects aimed at success in competitions. By comparing empirical studies and international experiences, it can be suggested that mental skills play a key role on a par with professional skills and physical performance. The analyzes reported show that the performance of high-level athletes is related to high cognitive and mental skills, and that the experience of senior athletes is characterized by complex psychological dimensions to train in junior athletes to achieve the same results in terms of performance.","theoretical models, sports performance, mental abilities, dimensions, theoretical paradigmsin, test psychological inventory, athletes, psychological constructs"
"Copyright and the Value of Performance, 1770–1911In the nineteenth century, copyright law expanded to include performances of theatrical and musical works. These laws transformed how people made and consumed performances. Exploring precedent-setting litigation on both sides of the Atlantic, this book traces how courts developed definitions of theater and music to suit new performance rights laws. From Gilbert and Sullivan battling to protect The Mikado to Augustin Daly petitioning to control his spectacularrailroad scene, artists worked with courts to refine vague legal language into clear, functional theories of drama, music, and performance. Through cases that ensnared figures including Lord Byron, Laura Keene, and Dion Boucicault, this book discovers how the law theorized central aspects of performance including embodiment, affect, audience response, and the relationship between scripts and performances. This history reveals how the advent of performance rights reshaped how we value performance both as an artistic medium and as property.","copyright law, nineteenth century, laws, musical works, performance rights, functional theories"
"Henry Hobhouses Tour Through Cumbria in 1774In the summer of 1774 three young men from Somerset embarked on a tour of England and part of Scotland which included a visit to Cumbria. Henry Hobhouse and his companions spent ten days travelling from Kirkby Lonsdale via Kendal and Ambleside to Keswick, from which they made a detour to Penrith and Ullswater. They then headed west via Cockermouth to industrial west Cumberland, travelling up the Irish Sea coast from Whitehaven to Allonby, then turning inland via Wigton to the city of Carlisle on their way to Scotland. Hobhouse’s journal of the tour includes accounts of their excursions to view the splendours of the Lake District – including boat trips on Derwent Water and Ullswater and an ascent of Skiddaw – but it also contains descriptions of the industrial ‘curiosities’ of the west Cumberland coalfield, the highlight of which was a subterranean tour of the colliery at Whitehaven. Hobhouse’s interests were wide-ranging and he comments throughout not only on aesthetics but on geology, farming and industry of all types. Henry Hobhouse’s account of his time in Cumbria, printed here, is an important addition to the early travel literature concerning the region. It is of particular interest as a hitherto unknown early tour, which took place four years before West’s Guide to the Lakes was published.","henry hobhouse, young men, west cumberland, cumbria"
"11 Publishing Sumerian Literature on the Semantic WebIn the three decades since the invention of the World Wide Web (henceforth,“the web”), archaeologists, museums, and experts in the study of ancient languages have published their knowledge regarding the archaeological, curatorial, and philological material of the ancient world online. For the most part, it has been in the form of text and images intended for humans, both experts and interested laypersons, to read. Technological developments, however, now enable us to publish data online in machine-readable formats, where it is as accessible to software (a program or application which runs on a computer, as opposed to the hardware, which is the physical machine itself) as it is to a human being. It is in those formats that a family of technologies around the concept of the Semantic Web (sw) comes into play. These tools can be used to make information accessible in ways that allows machines to “understand” the meaning of the content they encounter.The pragmatic implications of publishing datasets as Linked Data (ld) involve the social and academic considerations of trust, authority, data ownership, and copyright. The technical practicalities of data storage, server management, and user-interface generation represent another set of issues. From the perspective of capturing and representing expert knowledge, the development of the appropriate structural frameworks (known as “ontologies”)—through both the evaluation of existing models and the creation of new ones—plays a crucial role.

However, the tumour-reactive populations within the TIL products are not yet fully understood, for example, whether the target antigens are comprised mainly of neoantigens or shared antigens. Five HLA-A* 02-restricted gp100-targeting TCRs from one patient TIL sample have been identified using innovative paired TCR single cell sequencing. To create a simple model, the gp100-TCRs have been cloned into Jurkat cells for characterising their reactivity to matched patient tumour cells and commercially available melanoma lines, as well as to determine their peptide cross-reactivity profiles. We have shown that there are differences in the activation profile of the five TCRs identified and that these could be related to different MHC-peptide affinities when targeting tumour cells.

This analysis demonstrates that cover versions, versioning, editing, sampling, and remixing are dependent on copying and, for this reason, my eventual focus is on the relation of copies to originals and copies to copies.

"The Question Concerning Comics as Technology: Gestell and GridIn this article we argue that the comics grid, the array of panels, can be understood as a specific technology of ‘revealing’through ‘enframing’and as such is the key element in comics technology. We propose Martin Heidegger’s conceptual framework (Gestell: literally,‘the framework’), primarily discussed in his 1954 essay ‘The Question Concerning Technology’(1982) as a strategy that can be used to engage critically with panel layout in graphic narratives, concluding that the role of the grid in comics and the way that new technologies put that grid to work both in the production and consumption of comics means that comics embody the relationship between technology, storytelling and materiality. In an age in which most of the screens that dominate our information-filled lives are rectangular, we argue that the purpose of the grid is to manage a potentially overwhelming sublime space.",graphic narratives

The trend can be seen in the literary fiction of Tony Tulathimutte, Jarett Kobek, Thomas Pynchon, Don DeLillo, and Dave Eggers, to name but a few, but also in the trilogy of novels by Ann Bridges dubbed, ‘The Silicon Valley Trilogy’. Silicon Valley novels are concerned with the emergent technological industry in the Bay Area but they are also of a specific periodising moment.

"How China was connected to the international computer networksIn this book, we have adopted diverse theoretical perspectives to retrace digitization’s multiform process, highlighting certain characteristics and underlining some of the main mythologies that have fed into the analog to digital media transformation. The word myth is a highly complex one and a fundamental mechanism in human culture, as Bronislaw Malinowski, one of the fathers of anthropology, argued almost a century ago: myth “is not of the nature of fiction, such as we read today in a novel, but it is a living reality, believed to have once happened in primeval times, and continuing ever since to influence the world and human destinies” (, p. 78). In these final considerations, we address the issue of mythology, exploring at least two dimensions that encompass digital media’s myths. In the first place, myths emerge as symbolic narratives whose goal is to legitimize existing social and cultural practices that, in general …","china, diverse theoretical perspectives, human culture, multiform process, media transformation, international computer networksin, fundamental mechanism, bronislaw malinowski, word myth"
"Too cool for school? Gifted children and home schoolingIn this book, we have argued that concerns about home education have been repeatedly framed in terms of risk to children. Unsurprisingly, our research argues that many home educators object to such accounts. Rather, we find that the processes which families go through in order to home educate their children, for the most part can be understood as narratives in which parents are actively seeking to achieve the best outcomes for their children. Early in this book we argued that ‘heterogeneity rules’ both in terms of diversity in class, ethnicity and the relative affluence of different families, but also in terms of the reasons underpinning the decisions to home educate; and, it is also the case in terms of the type of home education different home educators deliver. Despite these differences what remains clear in our research was that families reflected on their decisions to home educate; they often worried about whether …","home schoolingin, gifted children, home education"
"A historiography of the hyperlink: Periodizing the web through the changing role of the hyperlinkIn this chapter I provide a historiography of one of the core elements of the web, the hypertext link. I do so with the specific purpose of tracing the various roles of this central web object as a way to understand social, technical, and commercial transformations of the web. That is, the hyperlink is positioned as a way to historicize larger web developments and as an alternative way to periodize the web. The dominant way of web periodization is through what Allen calls a ‘discourse of versions’(2013), established by Tim O’Reilly who labeled the period after the dot-com crash ‘Web 2.0’(2005), a marketing term he used to claim this period as new and upgraded, whilst at the same time promising a sense of continuity (Allen, 2013: 5). In doing so, O’Reilly invented the idea of Web 1.0 in retrospect and created a perception of the web before, Web 1.0, and after, Web 2.0, the dot-com crash (Allen, 2013).

"Human connectomics across the life spanIn this concluding chapter we summarize our theory advanced in this book and relate it to other cognitive, psychometric, and developmental theories. We also highlight how our theory resolves some old debates better than previous theories. These include the differentiation and integration of cognitive processes with development; the changes in the nature of general intelligence along differentiation/integration cycles; the decreasing likelihood of attaining later stages which demonstrates the developmental dimension of the normal distribution of IQ; social phenomena such as the secular increases of intelligence over the twentieth century; and the generalizability and transfer of learning from one process to the other.","human connectomics, cognitive processes, integration cycles, general intelligence, life spanin, developmental theories"
"Locating New Literary Practices in Indian Digital SpacesIn this essay, we locate and explore new literary practices and expressions in Indian digital spaces such as SMS novel and social media narratives: poetry, flash fiction, twitterfiction which are not considered as electronic literature in India. The integration of technology and creativity is not a novel phenomenon in Indian literature where one can find the narrative tradition of ancient Indian literature which includes poetical words, paintings, and music, for instance, Pattachitra, Ragamala paintings and Chitra Kavi. Similarly, new literary practices and expressions in the digital environment include literary artefacts such as interfaces, images, audio and videos. These works serve as a gateway to exciting electronic literature in India.","new literary practices, indian digital, electronic literature"
"Modelling: Thinking in Practice. An IntroductionIn this introduction of the HSR Supplement “Models and Modelling between Digital and Humanities - A Multidisciplinary Perspective” we refrain from providing a normative definition of ‘model’ and ‘modelling’ and rather attempt at encircling the current state of the art. In the first instance this chapter provides a very brief overview on modelling as intended as a research strategy applied to scientific fields in the 20th-21st centuries. This overview is followed by a short introduction to modelling in digital humanities, focusing on how modelling has developed into a practical strategy and how it has been theorised. The third part of the introduction presents the scope of the project ”Modelling between digital and humanities: Thinking in practice”. The aim of a project workshop held in 2017, of which this volume collects the proceedings, was to present a multitude of modelling practices from various disciplines together with …","strategy, normative definition, multidisciplinary perspective, hsr supplement"

"Face hallucination using cascaded super-resolution and identity priorsIn this paper we address the problem of hallucinating high-resolution facial images from unaligned low-resolution inputs at high magnification factors. We approach the problem with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and propose a novel (deep) face hallucination model that incorporates identity priors into the learning procedure. The model consists of two main parts: i) a cascaded super-resolution network that upscales the low-resolution images, and ii) an ensemble of face recognition models that act as identity priors for the super-resolution network during training. Different from competing super-resolution approaches that typically rely on a single model for upscaling (even with large magnification factors), our network uses a cascade of multiple SR models that progressively upscale the low-resolution images using steps of . This characteristic allows us to apply supervision signals (target appearances) at different resolutions and incorporate identity constraints at multiple-scales. Our model is able to upscale (very) low-resolution images captured in unconstrained conditions and produce visually convincing results. We rigorously evaluate the proposed model on a large datasets of facial images and report superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art.Subjects: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.

"Ground Truth for training OCR engines on historical documents in German Fraktur and Early Modern LatinIn this paper we describe a dataset of German and Latin\textit {ground truth}(GT) for historical OCR in the form of printed text line images paired with their transcription. This dataset, called\textit {GT4HistOCR}, consists of 313,173 line pairs covering a wide period of printing dates from incunabula from the 15th century to 19th century books printed in Fraktur types and is openly available under a CC-BY 4.0 license. The special form of GT as line image/transcription pairs makes it directly usable to train state-of-the-art recognition models for OCR software employing recurring neural networks in LSTM architecture such as Tesseract 4 or OCRopus. We also provide some pretrained OCRopus models for subcorpora of our dataset yielding between 95\%(early printings) and 98\%(19th century Fraktur printings) character accuracy rates on unseen test cases, a Perl script to harmonize GT produced by different transcription rules, and give hints on how to construct GT for OCR purposes which has requirements that may differ from linguistically motivated transcriptions.","15th century, ground truth, german fraktur, early modern latinin, text line images, transcription, historical documents, ocr engines, historical ocr"
"Tag-based browsing of digital collections with inverted indexes and browsing cacheIn this paper we describe one of the browsing strategies for learning object repositories implemented in the Clavy platform, a platform for the management of repositories with reconfigurable structures. Since Clavy makes it possible to dynamically modify the structure of the repositories, it must support a navigation model independent of that structure. For this purpose, the platform adopts a tag-based browsing model, according to which users select descriptive tags to filter learning objects (in Clavy, these descriptive tags correspond to element-value pairs). In our experience using Clavy, we have realized that updating the browsing state when the user changes the set of selected tags can be a costly process. The proposed strategy alleviates this cost by combining inverted indexes with a multilevel cache model that enables the system, on the one hand, to cache filtered objects (ie, set of objects filtered by sets of …","descriptive tags, cache, clavy platform, platform, digital collections, reconfigurable structures, browsing, object repositories"

"State of the Art Optical Character Recognition of 19th Century Fraktur Scripts using Open Source EnginesIn this paper we evaluate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of 19th century Fraktur scripts without book-specific training using mixed models, ie models trained to recognize a variety of fonts and typesets from previously unseen sources. We describe the training process leading to strong mixed OCR models and compare them to freely available models of the popular open source engines OCRopus and Tesseract as well as the commercial state of the art system ABBYY. For evaluation, we use a varied collection of unseen data from books, journals, and a dictionary from the 19th century. The experiments show that training mixed models with real data is superior to training with synthetic data and that the novel OCR engine Calamari outperforms the other engines considerably, on average reducing ABBYYs character error rate (CER) by over 70%, resulting in an average CER below 1%.","open source enginesin, state, mixed models, bookspecific training, optical character, 19th century fraktur scripts"
"Investigating entity linking in early english legal documentsIn this paper we investigate the accuracy and overall suitability of a variety of Entity Linking systems for the task of disambiguating entities in 17th century depositions obtained during the 1641 Irish Rebellion. The depositions are extremely difficult for modern NLP tools to work with due to inconsistent spelling, use of language and archaic references. In order to assess the severity of difficulty faced by Entity Linking systems when working with the depositions we use them to create an evaluation corpus. This corpus is used as an input to the General Entity Annotator Benchmarking Framework a standard benchmarking platform for entity annotation systems. Based on this corpus and the results obtained from General Entity Annotator Benchmarking Framework we observe that the accuracy of existing Entity Linking systems is lacking when applied to content like these depositions. This is due to a number of issues ranging …","modern nlp tools, irish rebellion, entity linking systems, depositions, archaic references, 17th century depositions, inconsistent spelling, evaluation corpus, benchmarking, early english legal documentsin"
"Scanning is Just the Beginning: Exploiting Text and Language Technologies to Enhance the Value of Historical ManuscriptsIn this paper we present a digital process for the explicitation of the textual, linguistic and semantic content of historical manuscripts. The proposed workflow is composed of a sequence of incremental steps, each of which is described both on a methodological and practical perspective. The steps are: 1) visualization and structuring of metadata, 2) transcription, 3) structural encoding, 4) annotation, 5) lexical and conceptual structuring.","text, semantic content, digital process, historical manuscriptsin, incremental steps, language technologies"
"(Dont) Mention the War: A Comparison of Wikipedia and Britannica Articles on National HistoriesIn this paper we present a large-scale quantitative comparison between expert-and crowdsourced writing of history by analysing articles from the English Wikipedia and Britannica. In order to quantify attention to particular periods, we extract mentioned year numbers and utilise them to study historical timelines of nations stretched over the last thousand years. By combining this temporal analysis with lexical analysis of both encyclopedic corpora we can identify distinctive historiographic points of view in each encyclopedia. We find that Britannica focuses on social and cultural phenomena, eg religion, as well as the geographical characteristics of states, while Wikipedia puts emphasis on political aspects, concentrating on wars and violent conflicts, and events of high popularity. Finally, both encyclopedias exhibit characteristics of English Academic prose, with Britannica being slightly less readable compared to …","geographical characteristics, national historiesin, temporal analysis, britannica articles, quantitative, comparison, wikipedia"
"A Distributional Semantic Methodology for Enhanced Search in Historical Records: A Case Study on SmellIn this paper we present a methodology based on distributional semantic models that can be flexibly adapted to the specific challenges posed by historical texts and that allow users to retrieve semantically relevant text without the need to close-read the documents. We focus on a case study concerned with detecting smell-related sentences in historical medical reports. We demonstrate a process for moving from generic domain label input to a more nuanced evaluation of the semantics of smell in a set of sentences extracted from this corpus, and then develop a machine learning technique for compounding scores on a variety of modelling parameters into more effective classifications.","specific challenges, machine learning technique, enhanced search, methodology, historical texts, historical records, distributional semantic methodology"
"Spelling errors of 24 cohorts of children across primary school 2012-2015: A corpus studyIn this paper we present a study of some spelling error types that Dutch primary school children made in the dictations and in the free or themed texts they contributed to the BasiScript corpus, i.e. a corpus comprising child written output produced between 2012 and 2015. The present article first briefly describes the corpus. Then it presents an analysis of the spelling errors that occurred in a selected set of words in the dictations regarding diphthongs (in grades 2 and 3) and verb forms (in grades 4 and 5) – which are notoriously difficult to spell for these age groups. In our analysis we investigate whether the frequencies of the words in the BasiLex corpus (a corpus of child written input) predict the spelling errors and whether there is a correlation between number of incorrect spellings of the words in the dictations and in the free texts and themed texts of the respective grades.","children, spelling errors, grades"

We present each annotation layer via basic label statistics and describe the final encoding of the resource in CoNLL and TEI formats. We also give a description of the rather turbulent history of the resource and give insights into the topic and genre distribution in the corpus. Finally, we discuss further enrichments of the corpus with additional layers, which are already underway.","annotation layer, basic label statistics, corpus, final encoding, semantic roles, dependency syntax, tei formats"
"Voices from the far right: a text analysis of Swedish parliamentary debatesIn this paper we study the effects of a radical right party entering a national parliament, on the parliament discourse. We follow the classification developed by Meguid (2008) and use a probabilistic topic model approach to analyze the 300,000 speeches delivered in the Swedish parliament between 1994 and 2017. Our results indicate that immigration became a more prevalent topic in party leader debates when the Sweden Democrats entered the parliament in 2010. The other parties started to address immigration more, but still not to the extent that the Sweden Democrats did. In 2015, as Sweden faced a migration crisis, immigration became a more salient issue in the parliamentary debates. This could be seen as an external shock that forced the mainstream parties to put more emphasis on the topic of immigration. We conclude that the mainstream parties used a partly dismissive, partly adversarial strategy in their speeches when the SD entered the parliament. The migration crises in 2015 made them focus more on immigration and they thereby adopted a more adversarial strategy.","probabilistic topic model approach, text analysis, mainstream parties, voices, sweden democrats, migration, national parliament, swedish parliament, party leader, parliament discourse, prevalent topic, speeches"
"Visualizing and Understanding the Operational Dynamics of a Shipping OperationIn this paper, a method is presented for visualizing and understanding the operational dynamics of a shipping operation. The method uses system performance measurement and functional signatures. System performance measurement allows assessors to understand the level of performance that is being achieved by the operation. The functional signatures then provides insight into the functional dynamics that occur for each level of performance. By combining system performance measurement with functional signatures, there is a framework to help understand what levels of performance are being achieved and why certain levels of performance are being achieved. The insight gained from this approach can be helpful in managing shipping operations. Data from an ice management ship simulator is used to demonstrate this method and compare different operational approaches.","shipping operation, system performance measurement, functional signatures, operational dynamics"
"Raw Harmonies: Transmediation through raw dataIn this paper, the authors present the initial findings from explorations on transformation patterns of data in raw format when crossing or transmediating directly (i.e., unaffected by any other form of codification) between audio and visual media. These patterns have allowed the authors to engage in the production of transmediatic artifacts with some degree of control and agency, facilitating purposeful applications of transmediation. The products of such practices will enable a form of literacy, an aesthetic means to identify in visual media artifacts those patterns that could transmediate into useful or appealing sonic artifacts and vice versa.","visual media, initial findings, artifacts, transformation patterns, transmediation, raw harmonies"

We evaluated the viability of IntersectionExplorer in the context of conference paper recommendation, through three user studies performed in different settings to understand the usefulness of the tool for diverse audiences and scenarios. We analyzed several dimensions of user experience and other, more objective, measures of performance. Results indicate that users found IntersectionExplorer to be a relatively fast and effortless tool to navigate through conference papers.

It can be also helpful for creating datasets of events falling into specific categories or for generating specialized timelines.","categories, category relevance, input entities, categorydriven retrieval, system, online system, historical eventsin, input text query, historical event retrieval"
"Using Neural Transfer Learning for Morpho-syntactic Tagging of South-Slavic Languages TweetsIn this paper, we describe a morpho-syntactic tagger of tweets, an important component of the CEA List DeepLIMA tool which is a multilingual text analysis platform based on deep learning. This tagger is built for the Morpho-syntactic Tagging of Tweets (MTT) Shared task of the 2018 VarDial Evaluation Campaign. The MTT task focuses on morpho-syntactic annotation of noncanonical Twitter varieties of three South-Slavic languages: Slovene, Croatian and Serbian. We propose to use a neural network model trained in an end-to-end manner for the three languages without any need for task or domain specific features engineering. The proposed approach combines both character and word level representations. Considering the lack of annotated data in the social media domain for South-Slavic languages, we have also implemented a cross-domain Transfer Learning (TL) approach to exploit any available related out-of-domain annotated data.","morphosyntactic tagging, vardial evaluation campaign, deep learning, southslavic languages, shared task, mtt task, neural transfer learning, southslavic languages tweetsin, morphosyntactic tagger, multilingual text analysis platform, tagger, important component"
"MADARi: A Web Interface for Joint Arabic Morphological Annotation and Spelling CorrectionIn this paper, we introduce MADARi, a joint morphological annotation and spelling correction system for texts in Standard and Dialectal Arabic. The MADARi framework provides intuitive interfaces for annotating text and managing the annotation process of a large number of sizable documents. Morphological annotation includes indicating, for a word, in context, its baseword, clitics, part-of-speech, lemma, gloss, and dialect identification. MADARi has a suite of utilities to help with annotator productivity. For example, annotators are provided with pre-computed analyses to assist them in their task and reduce the amount of work needed to complete it. MADARi also allows annotators to query a morphological analyzer for a list of possible analyses in multiple dialects or look up previously submitted analyses. The MADARi management interface enables a lead annotator to easily manage and organize the whole annotation process remotely and concurrently. We describe the motivation, design and implementation of this interface; and we present details from a user study working with this system.","morphological annotation, annotator, dialectal arabic, web interface, spelling correctionin, spelling correction system"

"Analyzing Visual Mappings of Traditional and Alternative Music NotationIn this paper, we postulate that combining the domains of information visualization and music studies paves the ground for a more structured analysis of the design space of music notation, enabling the creation of alternative music notations that are tailored to different users and their tasks. Hence, we discuss the instantiation of a design and visualization pipeline for music notation that follows a structured approach, based on the fundamental concepts of information and data visualization. This enables practitioners and researchers of digital humanities and information visualization, alike, to conceptualize, create, and analyze novel music notation methods. Based on the analysis of relevant stakeholders and their usage of music notation as a mean of communication, we identify a set of relevant features typically encoded in different annotations and encodings, as used by interpreters, performers, and readers of music. We analyze the visual mappings of musical dimensions for varying notation methods to highlight gaps and frequent usages of encodings, visual channels, and Gestalt laws. This detailed analysis leads us to the conclusion that such an under-researched area in information visualization holds the potential for fundamental research. This paper discusses possible research opportunities, open challenges, and arguments that can be pursued in the process of analyzing, improving, or rethinking existing music notation systems and techniques.","design space, visual mappings, music notation, information visualization, structured analysis"
"Arap-Tweet: A Large Multi-Dialect Twitter Corpus for Gender, Age and Language Variety IdentificationIn this paper, we present Arap-Tweet, which is a large-scale and multi-dialectal corpus of Tweets from 11 regions and 16 countries in the Arab world representing the major Arabic dialectal varieties. To build this corpus, we collected data from Twitter and we provided a team of experienced annotators with annotation guidelines that they used to annotate the corpus for age categories, gender, and dialectal variety. During the data collection effort, we based our search on distinctive keywords that are specific to the different Arabic dialects and we also validated the location using Twitter API. In this paper, we report on the corpus data collection and annotation efforts. We also present some issues that we encountered during these phases. Then, we present the results of the evaluation performed to ensure the consistency of the annotation. The provided corpus will enrich the limited set of available language resources for Arabic and will be an invaluable enabler for developing author profiling tools and NLP tools for Arabic.","multidialectal corpus, major arabic dialectal varieties, data collection, age categories, arab world, data, araptweet, annotation"

"Retro-digitizing and Automatically Structuring a Large Bibliography CollectionIn this paper, we present a generic workflow for retro-digitizing and structuring large entry-based documents, using the 33.000 entries of Internationale Bibliographie der Lexikographie, by Herbert Ernst Wiegand, as an example (published in four volumes (Wiegand 2006-2014)). The goal is to convert the large bibliography, at present available as collection of images, to TEI compliant XML, a structured format that enables enhanced interoperability and search functionalities (Lindemann, Kliche and Heid, 2018). Images of the printed publication are first processed with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools which are part of the Transkribus software application (Mühlberger and Terbul, 2018), 1 the output of which is used for creating manually validated Hand-Written Text Recognition (HTR) training material. The retro-digitised output is the used to train and create dedicated machine learning models in GROBID-Dictionaries 2 (Khemakhem, Foppiano and Romary, 2017), a tool for automatic segmentation of entry-based text documents and representation as TEI-compliant XML. Both Transkribus and GROBID-Dictionaries are tools freely available to the community. Preliminary results suggest that the proposed workflow yields good precision in retro-digitisation and segmentation.","generic workflow, internationale bibliographie der lexikographie, transkribus software application, herbert ernst wiegand, search functionalities, bibliography"
"Probabilistic variable-length segmentation of protein sequences for discriminative motif mining (DiMotif) and sequence embedding (ProtVecX)In this paper, we present peptide-pair encoding (PPE), a general-purpose probabilistic segmentation of protein sequences into commonly occurring variable-length sub-sequences. The idea of PPE segmentation is inspired by the byte-pair encoding (BPE) text compression algorithm, which has recently gained popularity in subword neural machine translation. We modify this algorithm by adding a sampling framework allowing for multiple ways of segmenting a sequence. PPE can be inferred over a large set of protein sequences (Swiss-Prot) and then applied to a set of unseen sequences. This representation can be widely used as the input to any downstream machine learning tasks in protein bioinformatics. In particular, here, we introduce this representation through protein motif mining and protein sequence embedding. (i) DiMotif: we present DiMotif as an alignment-free discriminative motif miner and evaluate the method for finding protein motifs in different settings. The  significant motifs extracted could reliably detect the integrins, integrin-binding, and biofilm formation-related proteins on a reserved set of sequences with high F1 scores. In addition, DiMotif could detect experimentally verified motifs related to nuclear localization signals. (ii) ProtVecX: we extend k-mer based protein vector (ProtVec) embedding to variable-length protein embedding using PPE sub-sequences. We show that the new method of embedding can marginally outperform ProtVec in enzyme prediction as well as toxin prediction tasks.","probabilistic variablelength segmentation, motifs, protein sequences, sequence embedding, discriminative motif, ppe"

"A Neural Network Model for Part-Of-Speech Tagging of Social Media TextsIn this paper, we propose a neural network model for Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging of User-Generated Content (UGC) such as Twitter, Facebook and Web forums. The proposed model is end-to-end and uses both character and word level representations. Character level representations are learned during the training of the model through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For word level representations, we combine several pre-trainned embeddings (Word2Vec, FastText and GloVe). To deal with the issue of the poor availability of annotated social media data, we have implemented a Transfer Learning (TL) approach. We demonstrate the validity and genericity of our model on a POS tagging task by conducting our experiments on five social media languages (English, German, French, Italian and Spanish).","partofspeech tagging, neural network, model, social media, partofspeech"

I cite two examples that occurred in the 2010s to explore the capacity of the Internet to defy the authoritarian regime’s rigid censorship. I argue that the Internet, as an instantaneous, interactive, participatory, and simultaneous medium, blurs the line between producers and consumers of the news.

"# GirlsLikeUs: Trans advocacy and community building onlineIn this research, we examine the advocacy and community building of transgender women on Twitter through methods of network and discourse analysis and the theory of networked counterpublics. By highlighting the network structure and discursive meaning making of the #GirlsLikeUs network, we argue that the digital labor of trans women, especially trans women of color, represents the vanguard of struggles over self-definition. We find that trans women on Twitter, led by Janet Mock and Laverne Cox, and in response to histories of misrepresentation and ongoing marginalization and violence, deliberately curate an intersectional networked counterpublic that works to legitimize and support trans identities and advocate for trans autonomy in larger publics and counterpublics.","girlslikeus, trans women, trans advocacy, network, transgender women, community building, advocacy"
"Categorical relevance judgmentIn this study we aim to explore users behavior when assessing search results relevance based on the hypothesis of categorical thinking. To investigate how users categories search engine results, we perform several experiments where users are asked to group a list of 20 search results into several categories, while attaching a relevance judgment to each formed category. Moreover, to determine how users change their minds over time, each experiment was repeated three times under the same conditions, with a gap of one month between rounds. The results show that on average users form 4–5 categories. Within each round the size of a category decreases with the relevance of a category. To measure the agreement between the search engines ranking and the users relevance judgments, we defined two novel similarity measures, the average concordance and the MinMax swap ratio.

We propose a multimodal framework based on random forest classifiers, which predict the actual environment among predefined generic classes of urban settings, inferring on real-time, non-invasive, ambulatory monitoring of brain and peripheral biosignals. Model performance reached 93% for the outdoor and 87% for the indoor environments (expressed in weighted AUROC), demonstrating the potential of the approach. Estimating the density distributions of the most predictive biomarkers, we present a series of geographic and temporal visualizations depicting the environmental contexts in which the most intense affective and cognitive reactions take place.

"A Messages Persuasive Features in Wikipedias Article for Deletion DiscussionsIn this study, we examine indicators of an OOC comments persuasive power in the context of Wikipedias Article for Deletion (AfD) discussions. Our preliminary results are in general consistent with the previous persuasion studies in Reddit discussion. Compared to non-persuasive comments, persuasive comments used less pronouns, impersonal pronouns, had lower sentiment level, and scored higher on analytical thinking and lower on authentic category. We also have different findings from the Reddit studies. Specifically, length of a comment and the use of complicated words are not strong indicators of an AfD comments persuasive power.

"A Preliminary Study of Proof of Concept Practices and their Connection with Information Systems and Information ScienceIn this study, we have identified that a Proof of Concept can be characterized as a research practice and instrument of knowledge creation, based on a set of activities that are applied to the study and understanding of certain objects by the actors involved. In Information Systems Development, we have characterized a Proof of Concept as a system that creates socio-technical phenomena and, with the aim of understanding these phenomena, we use the Context Engineering approach. Context Engineering represents the relationship between a set of essential movements in a new framework of activities of Information Systems Development. Furthermore, we highlight Information Science, which allows us to study in formal and rigorous ways the processes, techniques, conditions, and effects that are entailed in improving the efficacy of information, which is used for a range of purposes related to individual, social and …","research practice, context engineering approach, concept practices, sociotechnical phenomena, concept, knowledge creation, new framework, information systems, proof, essential movements"
"Exploratory Investigation of Word Embedding in Song Lyric Topic Classification: Promising Preliminary ResultsIn this work we investigate a data-driven vector representation of word embedding for the task of classifying song lyrics into their semantic topics. Previous research on topic classification of song lyrics has used traditional frequency based text representation. On the other hand, empirically driven word embedding has shown sensible performance improvment of text classification tasks, because of its ability to capture semantic relationship between words from big data. As averaging the word vectors from a short text is known to work reasonably well compared to the other comprehensive models utilizing their order, we adopt the averaged word vectors from the lyrics and user’s interpretations about them, which are short in general, as the feature for this classification task. This simple approach showed promising classification accuracy of 57%. From this, we envision the potential of the data-driven approaches to creating features, such as the sequence of word vectors and doc2vec models, to improve the performance of the system.","vector representation, song lyrics, exploratory investigation, word embedding, topic classification, performance, text representation, semantic relationship, text classification tasks, word vectors, models, word, promising preliminary resultsin"
"Never retreat, never retract: Argumentation analysis for political speechesIn this work, we apply argumentation mining techniques, in particular relation prediction, to study political speeches in monological form, where there is no direct interaction between opponents. We argue that this kind of technique can effectively support researchers in history, social and political sciences, which must deal with an increasing amount of data in digital form and need ways to automatically extract and analyse argumentation patterns. We test and discuss our approach based on the analysis of documents issued by R. Nixon and JF Kennedy during 1960 presidential campaign. We rely on a supervised classifier to predict argument relations (ie, support and attack), obtaining an accuracy of 0.72 on a dataset of 1,462 argument pairs. The application of argument mining to such data allows not only to highlight the main points of agreement and disagreement between the candidates arguments over the campaign issues such as Cuba, disarmament and health-care, but also an in-depth argumentative analysis of the respective viewpoints on these topics.","analysis, direct interaction, political speechesin, political sciences, argumentation mining, presidential campaign"

"No escape from the bulliesIn writing this book I sought to identify accessible storytelling theories and concepts most relevant to the development of interactive narratives. The future of this storytelling space is difficult to predict. Technology is evolving quickly, so we must keep an open mind, research historical works and experiment with what is available. Interactive narratives and transmedia story developers have a wide range of technical skills and abilities, but it is the ability to tell a good story that is fundamental to their success. Each year I set my students an assignment where they have to return the following week and tell a joke to the whole class. They need to consider the story set-up, the narrative hook, pacing and timing. To be honest, most find telling a joke to be an incredibly difficult piece of business. To begin with, they need to choose a decent joke that has the potential to make people laugh.

"Feature Descriptors for Spotting 3D Characters on Triangular MeshesIncreased use of 3D digitization methods leads to large numbers of 3D models with script like cuneiform tablets, temple wall inscriptions from the Mayan empire and Minoan and Mycenaean seal imprints. Analyzing and in particular comparing those objects in our projects is a core challenge for robust symbol-spotting and transcription of ancient scripts. The discrete manifolds using irregular grids describe the objects surface and contain complex shapes that cannot be wholly captured by a single rendering to a two dimensional plane in an image format. As the plethora of standard image descriptor extraction methods is not available on those 3D meshes we propose a novel approach adapting relevant image descriptor methods to process irregular grids. We show preliminary evaluations of our approach by performing a symbol spotting task on cuneiform tablets. Our approach proceeds in three stages: (i) We compute …","image descriptor, feature descriptors, temple wall inscriptions, 3d models, mycenaean seal imprints, 3d digitization methods, image, cuneiform tablets"
"Gateways to Digital Participation: The Rhetorical Function of Local Government WebsitesIncreasingly governments at all levels are becoming more transparent and accessible through their websites and portals, which provide citizens and residents with information and avenues for participation and collaboration. This chapter examines two local government websites in regional Victoria and Queensland (Australia) to understand how the rhetorical functions of these sites support or limit digital participation of their communities in the governance process. The discussion is framed within an understanding of ‘extraurbia’ as spaces that are symptoms of rapid population growth and changing social, economic and technological conditions.","digital participation, regional victoria, gateways, rhetorical function, local government websitesincreasingly"

"Optimal Sizing of a Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer System for Highway ApplicationsInductive power transfer has been proposed as a solution to power future automated and electrified highways. In this study, an interoperable wireless charging system is sized so that a light and a heavy-duty vehicle can travel at or near charge-sustaining mode at high speeds using an optimization approach. The conflicting objectives of minimizing the power ratings and the number of inverters, coupler materials, and overall system coverages result in a Pareto Front that is presented in this paper. It is found that a system using short transmitting couplers can ensure high efficiency power transfers to light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and still maintain charge-sustaining operation of heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs). The findings are contextualized by a brief discussion of other aspects relating to the implementation of this technology on roadways such as the impact of the cost of time and travel speeds.","interoperable wireless, high speeds, vehicles, heavyduty vehicle, system, optimal sizing, electrified highways"
"The university tea room: informal public spaces as ideas incubatorsInformal spaces encourage the meeting of minds and the sharing of ideas. They serve as an important counterpoint to the formal, silo-like structures of the modern organisation, encouraging social bonds and discussion across departmental lines. We address the role of one such institution – the university tea room – in Australia in the post-WWII decades. Drawing on a series of oral history interviews with economic historians, we examine the nature of the tea room space, demonstrate its effects on research within universities, and analyse the causes and implications of its decline in recent decades.","modern organisation, tea room, silolike structures, departmental lines, informal public spaces, social bonds, important counterpoint"
"Deep Neural Networks for Social Media Word Segmentation of Asian LanguagesInformation extraction today faces new challenges with noisy, short, unstructured data. This is especially the case for social media messages, such as tweets, in which language can be erroneous or cryptic, and contains references to a great number of new entities. Traditional NLP systems are challenged and need to develop new strategies to handle with these data. With the emergence of the neural network-based approach, the research about the word segmentation has benefited from large-scale raw texts by leveraging them for pretrained character and word embeddings. To this end, we experimented the use of both character and word embeddings to provide extra features to input layer of our neural network-based system architecture. This system has been tested on both Chinese and Japanese social media datasets. With the help of rich pretrained embeddings, our model achieved the promising results both …","new challenges, unstructured data, new entities, deep neural networks, social media"
"Accommodating the Third Space in a Fourth Society: BDAFRICA, a groundbreaking source for the analysis of African Literature Reception in SpainInherent features of African postcolonial literature have hampered reception quantification, which is even more often neglected in countries with limited experience of African decolonization processes. This has been exemplified through the Spanish case, where there was no quantitative data available to report on current reception trends. Hence, by exploiting the BDAFRICA database, a relevant specialized bibliographical research tool, we have provided an unparalleled study that covers 42 years of African literature reception in Spain (1972–2014). The methods described in this paper are descriptive. Quantitative information that is subject to a descriptive analysis has been selected from BDAFRICA. The results provide clear evidence of the sustained increase in the production of African fiction books and offer academia unparalleled data, thereby opening the door to manifold research lines.","bdafrica database, fourth society, limited experience, african postcolonial literature, descriptive analysis, spaininherent features, african literature reception, groundbreaking source"
"Visual Analysis and Exploration of Entity Relations in Document CollectionsInteractive text visualization can help users explore and gain insights into complex and often large document sets. One popular visualization strategy to represent such collections is to depict each document as a glyph in 2D space. These spaces have proven effective, especially when combined with interactive exploration methods. However, current exploratory approaches are largely limited to single areas of a 2D spatialization, lacking support for important comparative exploration and analysis tasks. In this paper, we extend a flexible focus+ context exploration technique to tackle this challenge. In particular, based on practical tasks from the digital humanities, we focus on exploring and investigating relationships between entities in large document collections. Our approach uses natural language processing to extract characters and places, including information about their relationships. We then use linked views to facilitate visual analysis of extracted information artifacts. Based on two usage scenarios, we demonstrate successful applications of the approach and discuss its benefits and limitations.","2d space, entity relations, document collectionsinteractive text visualization, analysis tasks, natural language processing, relationships, visual analysis"
"Visual Interactive Comparison of Part-of-Speech Models for Domain AdaptationInteractive visual analysis of documents relies critically on the ability of machines to process and analyze texts. Important techniques for text processing include text summarization, classification, or translation. Many of these approaches are based on part-of-speech tagging, a core natural language processing technique. Part-ofspeech taggers are typically trained on collections of modern newspaper, magazine, or journal articles. They are known to have high accuracy and robustness when applied to contemporary newspaper style texts. However, the performance of these taggers deteriorates quickly when applying them to more domain specific writings, such as older or even historical documents. Large training sets tend to be scarce for these types of texts due to the limited availability of source material and costly digitization and annotation procedures. In this paper, we present an interactive visualization approach that facilitates analysts in determining part-of-speech tagging errors by comparing several standard part-of-speech tagger results graphically. It allows users to explore, compare, evaluate, and adapt the results through interactive feedback in order to obtain a new model, which can then be applied to similar types of texts. A use case shows successful applications of the approach and demonstrates its benefits and limitations. In addition, we provide insights generated through expert feedback and discuss the effectiveness of our approach.","visual interactive, partofspeech models, text processing, newspaper, important techniques"
"The translator’s perspective on translation quality control processes for international large-scale assessment studiesInternational Large-Scale Assessment studies (iLSAs) like PISA (the Programme for International Student Assessment) and PIAAC (the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies) employ stringent quality control procedures for the translation of their test items. The translations are crucial: a test item should not become more or less difficult because of its translation, given that test results are used to assess and compare the competency levels of different populations across countries. This article discusses how PISA and PIAAC translation procedures have evolved from earlier translation quality processes, and the underlying assumptions about translation that have shaped this evolution. We then report on findings from a qualitative interview study with translators, reviewers, and translation managers who have been involved in PISA or PIAAC translation processes. The objective of the interview study is to analyse the quality control procedures from the perspective of translation players. How do translators prepare for and perform translations for iLSA studies, and how does this process compare with other translation assignments they receive? This comparison will give an understanding of whether translators, in general, believe the iLSA translation process and its quality control procedures provide adequate guidance for performing these translations. We finish by proposing recommendations for future iLSA translation processes.","international student assessment, international assessment, translation, largescale assessment"
"Mapping the international health aid community using web dataInternational aid is a complex system: it involves different issues, countries, and donors. In this paper, we use web crawling to collect information about the activities of international aid organizations on different health-related topics and network analysis to depict this complex system of relationships among organizations. By systematically collecting co-occurrences of issues, countries, and organization names from more than a hundred websites, we are able to construct multilayer networks describing, for instance, which issues are related to each other according to which organizations. Our results show that there is a surprising amount of homophily among organizations: organizations of the same type (multilateral, bilateral, private donors, etc.) tend to be co-cited in groups. We also create a taxonomy of issues that are generally mentioned together. Finally, we perform simulations, showing that messages originating from different organizations in the international aid community can have a different reach.","complex system, web, international aid organizations, international health aid community, private donors, network analysis"

"A longitudinal rehabilitation case study for hemiparetic gait using outdoor rhythmic haptic cueing via a wearable deviceIntroduction Improvement of gait is a high priority for hemiparetic stroke survivors. Auditory rhythmic cueing is a proven method for improving gait via entrainment but use is limited outside the lab. The lack of use in outdoor settings seems to reflect the problem that auditory cueing can be distracting and isolating out of doors, where survivors typically need to remain safe, aware of the environment. In such settings, haptic cueing offers an unobtrusive, invisible, sociable, safe alternative.  Research Question Existing studies have demonstrated improvements in temporal symmetry, increase in stride length and walking speed by means of post-stroke gait rehabilitation using wearable haptic devices in the lab. However, previous studies have been limited to laboratory settings and have focused on short-term improvements. By contrast, we present the first case study on the self-managed use of wearable haptics for gait rehabilitation via entrainment in outdoor settings, and the first findings from applying this technique over a number of days.  Methods A longitudinal pilot study was conducted with a single hemiparetic participant providing rhythmic haptic cueing using a wearable haptic device for a two-week period. The participant was asked to walk in synchrony to the haptic rhythm at a suitable outdoor setting for a minimum of 10 minutes each day. Gait data was measured before and after the two-week intervention using lab-based IMU sensors.  Results On comparing before and after gait characteristics, preliminary results showed substantial improvement in temporal symmetry and walking speed.  Conclusions There is implications for potential long-term …","haptic cueing, rhythmic haptic cueing, hemiparetic stroke survivors, hemiparetic gait, auditory rhythmic cueing"
"The Effect of Nocturnal Oxygen Desaturations on Plasma Levels of Nf-κB-Controlled Gene Products in Patients with Obstructive Sleep ApneaIntroduction Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) with reoxygenation, a phenomenon that induces oxidative stress and activates the oxidantsensitive transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), a known contributor to inflammationinduced atherogenesis. Although recent studies have shown that patients with OSA have increased plasma levels of NF-κB-controlled gene products soluble E (sE)-selectin and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), the responsible mechanisms have not been fully identified. Thus, we analyzed the effect of nocturnal oxygen desaturations (NOD) on (sE)-selectin and sVCAM-1 in patients with OSA before continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.

"Janeway: a scholarly communications platformIt is a terrible mistake to think that technological platforms are what make or break a scholarly communications enterprise. Yet, the technology that drives submissions and article presentation does sit at the heart of user interaction. Technologies also have knock-on effects for running a publishing business. If you run a legacy system that requires three senior engineers who are all proficient in six different technological stacks, then your staff costs will be substantially higher.Bearing these considerations in mind, the Centre for Technology and Publishing at Birkbeck, University of London embarked upon building a journal submission and hosting platform, Janeway, learning from our experiences of running the Open Library of Humanities (OLH). We knew Open Journal Systems (OJS) well at this time, but were not big fans of PHP, the language in which it is written. We also were aware of the work being done by Coko (the Collaborative Knowledge Foundation) in Node. js. What we really craved, though, was a scholarly communications platform written in Python/Django. This was not just a language preference but was also linked to issues around hiring and simplicity, as mentioned above. Python was the most popular programming language in 2017, which would mean that a platform in this language would be comprehensible to a wide range of programmers. 1 So, we chose to write in Python using the Django framework, since this is a well-known, stable, and secure framework for the development of web applications.

"The extreme value machineIt is often desirable to be able to recognize when inputs to a recognition function learned in a supervised manner correspond to classes unseen at training time. With this ability, new class labels could be assigned to these inputs by a human operator, allowing them to be incorporated into the recognition function-ideally under an efficient incremental update mechanism. While good algorithms that assume inputs from a fixed set of classes exist, e.g., artificial neural networks and kernel machines, it is not immediately obvious how to extend them to perform incremental learning in the presence of unknown query classes. Existing algorithms take little to no distributional information into account when learning recognition functions and lack a strong theoretical foundation.

Not just a study of McGahern “the reader”, the book is a vast and far-reaching study of the assimilation of great literary works and their tradition within McGahern’s imagination and oeuvre. Van der Ziel quickly dismisses any attempt to add to the existing body of analysis and criticism on the social and cultural context which undoubtedly acted as a well-spring of ideas and context for McGahern’s work.

Recent trends in population mobility, cultural intermingling, globalisation, migration, have rendered this traditional tasN2if not obsolete2at least barely sufficient for the explanation of relationships in the literary field. This essay aims to present a mobility turn in Romanian literary studies, which altered the traditional relationships between comparative literature and national literature while at the same time urging comparatists themselves to rethinN their tools, their methodological approaches and their worN object. A secondary scope of this text is to open a list of presentYday challenges to be faced by European comparative studies in general, and by their Romanian practices in particular.

"Distant Horizons: Digital Evidence and Literary ChangeJust as a traveler crossing a continent won’t sense the curvature of the earth, one lifetime of reading can’t grasp the largest patterns organizing literary history. This is the guiding premise behind Distant Horizons, which uses the scope of data newly available to us through digital libraries to tackle previously elusive questions about literature. Ted Underwood shows how digital archives and statistical tools, rather than reducing words to numbers (as is often feared), can deepen our understanding of issues that have always been central to humanistic inquiry. Without denying the usefulness of time-honored approaches like close reading, narratology, or genre studies, Underwood argues that we also need to read the larger arcs of literary change that have remained hidden from us by their sheer scale. Using both close and distant reading to trace the differentiation of genres, transformation of gender roles, and surprising persistence of aesthetic judgment, Underwood shows how digital methods can bring into focus the larger landscape of literary history and add to the beauty and complexity we value in literature.","distant horizons, ted underwood, literary history, largest patterns, literary changejust, statistical tools, digital evidence"

"Kiri Miller, Playable Bodies: Dance Games and Intimate MediaKiri Miller’s captivating and highly readable analysis of dance games draws upon and contributes to ethnomusicology, videogame studies, and dance and performance studies across an introduction, six chapters, and a companion website. Playable Bodies: Dance Games and Intimate Media considers the home videogames Just Dance and Dance Central, games that ask players to dance along with an onscreen dancer while the gaming systems evaluate and score the players’ efforts at embodying the choreography. As Miller discusses, players are active participants in an online culture that has arisen around these games, offering assessments of the musical selections, choreographed routines, and onscreen characters, as well as recording and uploading videos of themselves playing/dancing to YouTube.","intimate mediakiri miller, playable bodies, kiri miller, dance games, readable analysis, onscreen, intimate media"
"Improving comprehension of knowledge representation languages: A case study with Description LogicsKnowledge representation languages are frequently difficult to understand, particularly for those not trained in formal logic. This is the case for Description Logics, which have been adopted for knowledge representation on the Web and in a number of application areas. This work looks at the difficulties experienced with Description Logics; and in particular with the widely-used Manchester OWL Syntax, which employs natural language keywords. The work comprises three studies. The first two identify a number of difficulties which users experience, e.g. with negated intersection, functional properties, the use of subproperties and restrictions. Insights from cognitive psychology and the study of language are applied to understand these difficulties. Whilst these difficulties are in part inherent in reasoning about logic, and Description Logics in particular, they are made worse by the syntax. In the third study, alternative …","description logicsknowledge representation languages, knowledge representation, application areas, difficulties, negated intersection, knowledge representation languages, description logics, manchester owl syntax, formal logic, comprehension"
"Humble Humbugs and Good Frauds: Harold Frederic, Christian Science, and the Anglo-American ProfessionsL. Ashley Squires, “Humble Humbugs and Good Frauds: Harold Frederic, Christian Science, and the Anglo-American Professions” (pp. 353–378)In October 1898, American novelist Harold Frederic died of complications following a stroke while in the care of a Christian Scientist named Athalie Goodman Mills, summoned to his bedside by the author’s mistress, Kate Lyon. His death was later the subject of a coroner’s inquest and unsuccessful manslaughter charge, making the author’s death central to an already raging debate about the efforts of an ascendant medical profession to criminalize the activities of healers they saw as illegitimate. This essay reads the public controversy as represented in newspapers and medical journals alongside Frederic’s The Damnation of Theron Ware (1896), arguing that both texts demonstrate a widening epistemic gap between an ascendant class of experts and the broader public …","unsuccessful manslaughter charge, ascendant, athalie goodman mills, christian scientist, christian science, humble humbugs, harold frederic, angloamerican professions, death, public controversy, good frauds"
"Building a Rich Lexical Resource for Standard ArabicLanguage ambiguity is an inherent characteristic of natural languages. It refers to the phenomenon where an instance can be interpreted in multiple ways. Ambiguity is at the core of the problems faced by natural language processing applications (Obeid et al. 2013). Although humans have the ability to resolve such ambiguity based on their prior knowledge and context, there are instances (sentences, words,... etc) that require multiple readings to resolve it within a context (Hawwari et al. 2013; Diab et al. 2008). The problem of natural language ambiguity is further exacerbated by conventional orthographic decisions where not all phonemes are explicitly represented (Maamouri et al. 2010; Maamouri et al. 2012). Arabic standard orthography is one of these languages that is underspecified for some of the characters such as short vowels, gemination, glottal stops, etc which are collectively represented as diacritics …","rich lexical resource, standard arabiclanguage ambiguity, multiple, natural languages, inherent characteristic"
"Challenges in the Management of Large Corpora (CMLC-6)Large corpora require careful design, licensing, collecting, cleaning, encoding, annotation, management, storage, retrieval, analysis, and curation to unfold their potential for a wide range of research questions and users, across a number of disciplines. Apart from the usual CMLC topics that fall into these areas, the 6th edition of the CMLC workshop features a special focus on corpus query and analysis systems and specifically on goals concerning their interoperability. In the past 5 years, a whole new generation of corpus query engines that overcome limitations on the number of tokens and annotation layers has started to emerge at several research centers. While there seems to be a consensus that there can be no single corpus tool that fulfills the need of all communities and that a degree of heterogeneity is required, the time seems ripe to discuss whether (further, unrestricted) divergence should be avoided in order to allow for some interoperability and reusability–and how this can be achieved. The two most prominent areas where interoperability seems highly desirable are query languages and software components for corpus analysis. The former issue is already partially addressed by the proposed ISO standard Corpus Query Lingua Franca (CQLF). Components for corpus analysis and further processing of results (eg for visualization), on the other hand, should in an ideal world be exchangeable and reusable across different platforms, not only to avoid redundancies, but also to foster replicability and a canonization of methodology in NLP and corpus linguistics. The 6th edition of the workshop is meant to address these issues, notably by …","management, corpus, corpus query, cmlc workshop, 6th edition, careful design, challenges, query, corpus analysis"
"Ruts of Gentrification: Breaking the Surface of Viennas Changing CityscapeLast year, the city of Vienna celebrated the 150-year anniversary of the opening of the Ringstrasse, the central ring road that stands as symbol of the huge structural renewal that accompanied the transformation of the Habsburg empires capital into a rapidly growing modern city. The anniversary acquired poignancy on account of the way Viennas population is once again growing rapidly, with an estimated ¼ million people to be added to the citys population over the next decade. While accommodating urban migrants was not a priority in Ringstrasse Vienna, and working class districts are not part of iconic mapped mediations, the current city council, a coalition of Social Democrats and the Green Party, studiously tries to avoid 19th-century urban modernitys ""mistakes"" in their efforts to accommodate the growing population, and they let the Viennese, and the world, know. This time, GIS and digital mapping are mobilized for planning, mediating and communicating large-scale development and renewal projects.  This paper looks at the mediations of three crucial sites of contemporary urban transformation in Vienna that mobilize the affordances of new technologies: ""Loftcity,"" a loft development cum cultural centre on the site of one of Viennas largest factories, the Ankerbrotfabrik; the transformation of the district surrounding Viennas new Hauptbahnhof; and Aspern, ""Viennas Urban Lakeside,"" a new satellite town promoted as a city of the future. By comparing the historical traces that remain in the mediations of these sites with their 19 th-century counterparts, a geocritical reading of Viennas gentrification emerges that situates spatial practices in …","vienna, development, gentrification, contemporary urban transformation, habsburg empire"
"The “Parallel Evolutions” of Medieval Law and LiteratureLaw and literature in the medieval period may be understood to share a parallel evolution in two senses. The first is that suggested by Richard Firth Green in his classic study Crisis of Truth. Green explains that he treated medieval law and literature as “parallel forms of discourse, each with its own conventions and traditions,” and that he reads between those parallels to determine “how the lawyer’s comparatively more formal analysis of mental or social processes can help us understand what the imaginative writer sometimes leaves unspoken or expresses only obliquely.” 1 Reading between medieval law and literature provides us with more information about that elusive chimera, the medieval worldview, than a study of just one or the other ever could.In its second and more fundamental sense, the title of this chapter refers to the evolution of the parallel itself, as the very opposing categories “law” and “literature” are themselves medieval developments. One helpful way of tracing this opposition’s origins is through examining the etymologies of the English words.“Law” is a loan word from Old Norse, and its adoption reflects the cultural and political influence of the so-called “Vikings” on English-speaking peoples in the centuries leading up to the Norman conquest. 2 “Literature,” meanwhile, is derived from the Latin adjective litteratus or “literate.” This term referred through much of the medieval period to literacy in its most basic technical sense, and only regains its connotations of erudition with the ascendancy of “humanist” classicism in late medieval clerical culture. 3","medieval law, parallel evolutions, richard firth green"
"The LALA Project: Building Capacity to Use Learning Analytics to Improve Higher Education in Latin America.Learning Analytics has been widely developed in European countries. Latin America is also starting to measure and optimize teaching and learning processes through Learning Analytics. However, the existing attempts in this direction are very isolated. Further efforts are needed in order to promote greater sharing of best practices between regions. Along these lines, the present work presents the LALA project with the aim of building capacity to use Learning Analytics to improve higher education in Latin America. At the end of the project we expect to have built local capacity for decision-making by using educational data, a community of practice around learning analytics, and a methodological framework to guide Latin American institutions to adopt tools to support learning.","learning analytics, building capacity, higher education, lala project, latin america, european countries"
"Legal Deposit Web Archives and the Digital Humanities: A Universe of Lost Opportunity?Legal deposit libraries have archived the web for over a decade. Several nations, supported by legal deposit regu-lations, have introduced comprehensive national domain web crawling, an essential part of the national library re-mit to collect, preserve and make accessible a nation’s intellectual and cultural heritage (Brazier, 2016). Scholars have traditionally been the chief beneficiaries of legal de-posit collections: in the case of web archives, the poten-tial for research extends to contemporary materials, and to Digital Humanities text and data mining approaches. To date, however, little work has evaluated whether legal deposit regulations support computational approaches to research using national web archive data (Brügger, 2012; Hockx-Yu, 2014; Black, 2016). This paper examines the impact of electronic legal deposit (ELD) in the United Kingdom, particularly how the 2013 regulations influence innovative scholarship using the Legal Deposit UK Web Archive. As the first major case study to analyse the implementation of ELD, it will ad-dress the following key research questions:• • Is legal deposit, a concept defined and refined for print materials, the most suitable vehicle for suppor-ting DH research using web archives? • How does the current framing of ELD affect digital in-novation in the UK library sector? • How does the current information ecology, including not for-profit archives, influence the relationship between DH researchers and legal deposit libraries?","legal deposit web archives, digital humanities"
"Drawing Clustered Graphs on Disk ArrangementsLet  be a planar graph and let  be a partition of . We refer to the graphs induced by the vertex sets in  as Clusters. Let  be an arrangement of disks with a bijection between the disks and the clusters. Akitaya et al. give an algorithm to test whether  can be embedded onto  with the additional constraint that edges are routed through a set of pipes between the disks. Based on such an embedding, we prove that every clustered graph and every disk arrangement without pipe-disk intersections has a planar straight-line drawing where every vertex is embedded in the disk corresponding to its cluster. This result can be seen as an extension of the result by Alam et al. who solely consider biconnected clusters. Moreover, we prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether a clustered graph has such a straight-line drawing, if we permit pipe-disk intersections.","disk arrangementslet, vertex sets, clustered graphs, arrangement, planar graph, pipedisk, planar straightline drawing"
"Evolving Views on Vocabulary DevelopmentLexical development in a second language (L2) is increasingly understood to be complex and multidimensional (Kim, Crossley, & Kyle, 2018; Pellicer-Sánchez, 2016). Knowledge of a word or expression may be at different levels of depth—that is, recognizing the word receptively, being able to use it productively, knowing its associated word family, or being able to understand and use it in non-literal expressions and pragmatically appropriate ways (Elgort, 2017). Vocabulary learning occurs over time and is dependent on learner actions and on multiple encounters with a given item. Words are “open systems”(Churchill, 2007, p. 354); word knowledge emerges dynamically and contingently through context and user interactions (Kasper & Wagner, 2018). The process involved thus invites the application of a dynamic systems or complexity theory (CT) perspective (Godwin-Jones, 2018a).Research in cognitive linguistics has led to new insights into the process of vocabulary acquisition (Bisson, Van Heuven, Conklin, & Tunney, 2013). Studies have shown, for example, that words have psychological properties—subjective characteristics such as the level of concreteness or imageability—which affect retention (Crossley, Kyle, & Salsbury, 2016). Such insights have been confirmed and expanded through eye-tracking research that looks at vocabulary comprehension in L2 reading (Pellicer-Sánchez & Siyanova-Chanturia, 2018). At the same time, work in corpus linguistics has changed how we understand the nature of language and language learning (Rousse-Malpat & Verspoor, 2018). Native speaker corpora show how language is actually used, while …","vocabulary developmentlexical development, linguistics, views, word, l2 reading, knowledge, language"
"Environmental factors drive language density more in food-producing than in hunter–gatherer populationsLinguistic diversity is a key aspect of human population diversity and shapes much of our social and cognitive lives. To a considerable extent, the distribution of this diversity is driven by environmental factors such as climate or coast access. An unresolved question is whether the relevant factors have remained constant over time. Here, we address this question at a global scale. We approximate the difference between pre- versus post-Neolithic populations by the difference between modern hunter–gatherer versus food-producing populations. Using a novel geostatistical approach of estimating language and language family densities, we show that environmental—chiefly climate factors—have driven the language density of food-producing populations considerably more strongly than the language density of hunter–gatherer populations. Current evidence suggests that the population dynamics of modern hunter …","language density, language family densities, cognitive lives, human population diversity, modern hunter, gatherer populations"
"Claiming Commerce, Quality and Credit: Raisons d’être of the Antwerp and Brussels tapissierspanden (Sixteenth–Eighteenth Centuries)Literature on the Antwerp and Brussels tapissierspanden tends to give a one-dimensional account of the institutions as very similar commercial enterprises that were embraced wholeheartedly by everyone involved in the Antwerp and Brussels tapestry worlds since they all shared the same concerns and a single goal — namely, to develop and secure a central meeting point and marketplace. This essay, however, adopts a different vantage point. It discusses the tapissierspanden from the viewpoint of the conflicting business conduct and strategies developed by Antwerp city council and tapestry entrepreneurs on the one hand, and Brussels tapestry entrepreneurs on the other. This essay argues that those who founded the institutions in Antwerp and Brussels established and used them to further completely different objectives — and that their strategies, which both manifested themselves and crystallised in the …","tapestry entrepreneurs, antwerp, brussels tapestry, conflicting business conduct, commerce, antwerp city council, brussels tapissierspanden, onedimensional account"
"Meico: A Converter Framework for Bridging the Gap between Digital Music Editions and its ApplicationsMEI, the established representation format for digital music editions, barely finds consideration in other music-related communities. Reasons are the formats complexity and ambiguity that make processing expensive and laborious. On the other hand, digital music editions are an invaluable source of symbolic music data and further accompanying information far beyond the typical metadata found in other formats. With meico, we provide a novel tool that makes access, processing and use of MEI encoded music more convenient and appealing for other application scenarios. Meico is a converter framework that translates MEI data to a series of formats relevant to many other applications. With ScoreTube we demonstrate this in an audio-to-score alignment scenario.","digital music editions, established representation format, meico, converter framework"

"Toward a Cognitive Evaluation Approach for Machine Translation PostEditingMachine Translation (MT) today is used more and more by professional translators, including freelancers, companies, and official organisations, such as, for example, the European Parliament. MT output, especially of publicly available MT engines, such as Google Translate, is, however, well known to contain errors and lack fluency from human expectations» point of view. For this reason, the MT translated texts often need manual (or automatic) corrections, known as `Post-Editing» (PE).Although there are fast and simple measures of post-editing cost, such as time to post-edit, or edit-distance, these measures do not reflect the cognitive difficulty involved in correcting the specific errors in the MT output text. As the MT output texts can be of different quality and thus contain errors of different difficulty to be corrected, fair compensation of post-editing should take into account the difficulty of the task, which should thus be …","human expectations, european parliament, cognitive evaluation, official organisations, errors, mt output, professional translators, machine translation posteditingmachine translation, lack fluency, difficulty"
"Using human brain activity to guide machine learningMachine learning is a field of computer science that builds algorithms that learn. In many cases, machine learning algorithms are used to recreate a human ability like adding a caption to a photo, driving a car, or playing a game. While the human brain has long served as a source of inspiration for machine learning, little effort has been made to directly use data collected from working brains as a guide for machine learning algorithms. Here we demonstrate a new paradigm of “neurally-weighted” machine learning, which takes fMRI measurements of human brain activity from subjects viewing images, and infuses these data into the training process of an object recognition learning algorithm to make it more consistent with the human brain. After training, these neurally-weighted classifiers are able to classify images without requiring any additional neural data. We show that our neural-weighting approach can lead to …","training process, algorithms,  machine learning, human brain, human ability, machine learning"
"Visual Quality Guidance for Document Exploration with Focus+ Context TechniquesMagic lens based focus+context techniques are powerful means for exploring document spatializations. Typically, they only offer additional summarized or abstracted views on focused documents. As a consequence, users might miss important information that is either not shown in aggregated form or that never happens to get focused. In this work, we present the design process and user study results for improving a magic lens based document exploration approach with exemplary visual quality cues to guide users in steering the exploration and support them in interpreting the summarization results. We contribute a thorough analysis of potential sources of information loss involved in these techniques, which include the visual spatialization of text documents, user-steered exploration, and the visual summarization.

"Making and assemblingMaking and assembling produce an odd pairing of terms. Making derives from the short vocalization ‘mek’from an Anglo-Saxon word, and hearkens to the Germanic verb ‘machen’meaning to do or to make. It has both a universal application, in the sense that everyone from children to adults makes sound, while on the other hand, it aligns with specialists who form unique or distinctive works, such as a fine machine or a beautiful painting. Making, or doing, also leads us directly to processes whereby materials become transformed by an action, such as a person making a cocktail or the weather making us feel hot. On the other hand, assembling is Latinate, as with the French verb ‘assembler’, in English also to assemble, as in the putting together or gathering of people, objects or things. Etymologically, this latter term relates then to the important notion of ‘assembly’as a site of public cultural enactment, as well as to the assembly line of Fordist manufacturing. We might also have a more prosaic view of assembling in contemporary culture when we consume the plasticity of a robotics toy, a piece of IKEA furniture, or a Facebook page. Thus, we might conceive of a sharp contrast between making and assembling as methods, in the sense that making suggests creating, and something more primal, fashioned even from mud, whereas assembling tends towards order, and something more civilized, or institutional. We do not assert this dichotomy in any cultural hierarchy because we prefer to examine these terms operating in relation to one another, and as moving generatively between the social and linguistic, or human and non-human, in contemporary …","public cultural enactment, odd pairing, important notion, germanic verb, assembly line, distinctive works, anglosaxon word, short vocalization"

"Using Dynamic Hypergraphs to Reveal the Evolution of the Business Network of a 17th Century French Woman MerchantMany digital humanity use cases require the analysis of relationships between entities (eg people or countries). The analysis of those relationships is particularly difficult when these relations change over time. A common representations of such relations is through graphs, which connect pairs of entities. However, in the real world relationships are often more complex and can be better described using hypergraphs (where edges can connect more than two entities). In this paper, we present a digital humanity case study of the analysis of people mentioned in 16th and 17th Century legal documents, modeled as a dynamic hypergraph. We use a new representation called Parallel Aggregated Ordered Hypergraph. Our prototype implementation of Parallel Aggregated Ordered Hypergraph, and the benefits of the PAOH representation are discussed.","hypergraphs, business network, common representations, dynamic hypergraphs"
"A Taxonomy of Asynchronous Instructional Video StylesMany educational organizations are employing instructional videos in their pedagogy, but there is a limited understanding of the possible video formats. In practice, the presentation format of instructional videos ranges from direct recording of classroom teaching with a stationary camera, or screencasts with voice-over, to highly elaborate video post-production. Previous work evaluated the effectiveness of several production styles, but there has not been any consistent taxonomy, which would have made comparisons and meta-analyses possible. Therefore, we need a taxonomy of instructional video formats that facilitates the understanding of the landscape of available instructional video production styles. For this purpose, we surveyed the research literature and examined contemporary video-based courses, which have been produced by diverse educational organizations and teachers across several academic disciplines. We organized instructional video styles in two dimensions according to the level of human presence and to the type of instructional media. In addition to organizing existing instructional videos in a comprehensive way, the proposed taxonomy offers a design space, which should facilitate choice, as well as the preparation of novel video formats.","diverse educational organizations, presentation format, instructional video, limited understanding, production, video formats"

These embeddings are learnt from data that has been gathered"" from the wild"" and have been found to contain unwanted biases. In this paper we make three contributions towards measuring, understanding and removing this problem. We present a rigorous way to measure some of these biases, based on the use of word lists created for social psychology applications; we observe how gender bias in occupations reflects actual gender bias in the same occupations in the real world; and finally we demonstrate how a simple projection can significantly reduce the effects of embedding bias.

"The Republic of Games: Textual Culture between Old Books and New MediaMany of today’s digital platforms are designed according to the same model: they encourage users to create content for fun (a mode of production that some have termed playbour) and to earn points. On Facebook, for example, points are based on a user’s number of friends and how many likes and shares a comment receives. New cultural and literary formations have arisen out of these feedback and reward systems, with surprising effects on amateur literary production. Drawing on social-text analysis, platform studies, and game studies, Elyse Graham shows that embedding game structures in the operations of digital platforms–a practice known in corporate circles as “gamification”–can have large cumulative effects on textual ecosystems. Making the production of content feel like play helps to drive up the volume of text being written, and as a result, gamification has gained widespread popularity online, especially among social media platforms, fan forums, and other sites of user-generated content. The Republic of Games argues that a consequence of this profound increase in the volume of text being produced is a reliance on self-contained, user-based systems of information management to deal with the mass of new content. Opening up new avenues of analysis in contemporary media studies and the humanities, The Republic of Games sifts through the gamified patterns of writing, interacting, and meaning-making that define the digital revolution.","games, digital platforms, literary formations, textual culture, new mediamany, republic, content, systems"
"Wearables for Long Term Gait Rehabilitation of Neurological ConditionsMany people with long-term neurological and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke, brain injury, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease suffer from an impaired walking gait pattern. Gait improvement can lead to better fluidity in walking, improved health outcomes, greater independence, and enhanced quality of life. Existing lab-based studies with wearable devices have shown that rhythmic haptic cueing can cause immediate improvements to gait features such as temporal symmetry, stride length and walking speed. However, current wearable systems are unsuitable for self-managed use, and to move this approach from out of the lab into long-term sustained usage, numerous design challenges need to be addressed. We are designing, developing, and testing a closed-loop system to provide adaptive haptic rhythmic cues for sustainable self-managed long-term use outside the lab by survivors of stroke, and other neurological conditions, in their everyday lives.","rhythmic haptic cueing, impaired walking gait pattern, neurological conditionsmany, improved health outcomes, brain injury, multiple sclerosis, gait improvement, wearable, longterm"

"A Call for a Corpus-Based Sign Language Dictionary: An Overview of Croatian Sign Language Lexicography in the Early 21st CenturyMany sign languages today are still not standardized nor accessible to a wider audience. Sign languages with high quality dictionaries are scarce. In this paper we give a brief description of sign languages and how they differ from spoken ones, in order to better understand the issues lexicographers might face when compiling dictionaries for these languages. We focus on Croatian Sign Language (HZJ), giving an overview of the cur- rent situation in HZJ lexicography following some criteria we find relevant for both online and printed sign language dictionaries. The criteria have been classified into twenty-five categories and applied to create a mod- el for an online HZJ dictionary, briefly presented in this paper. By presenting an unsatisfactory status of HZJ lexicography, we are issuing an urgent call for the compilation of a HZJ corpus as a basis for a high quality dictionary that could benefit both the potential hearing and deaf users.","sign language, dictionaries, hzj lexicography, sign languages, wider audience"

The VA module was developed by Indiana University’s (IU) Research Technologies division in conjunction with IU’s Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center (CNS) and the University at Buffalo’s Center for Computational Research (CCR). It interrelates quantitative measures of information technology (IT) usage, external funding, and publications in support of IT strategic decision making. This paper details the data, analysis workflows, and visual mappings used in the two VA visualizations that aim to communicate the value of different IT usage in terms of NSF and NIH funding, resulting publications, and associated research collaborations. To illustrate the feasibility of measuring IT values on research, we measured its financial and academic impact from the period between 2012 and 2017. The financial return on investment (ROI) is measured in terms of the funding, totaling $ 21,016,055 for NIH and NSF projects, and the academic ROI constitutes 1,531 NIH and NSF awards and 968 publications associated with 83 NSF and NIH awards. In addition, the results show that Medical Specialties, Brain Research, and Infectious …","substantial resources, xd metrics, information technology, demand, external funding, collaboration networksmany universities, campusbased cyberinfrastructure, university"
"Re-Mapping Archaeology: Critical Perspectives, Alternative MappingsMaps have always been a fundamental tool in archaeological practice, and their prominence and variety have increased along with a growing range of digital technologies used to collect, visualise, query and analyse spatial data. However, unlike in other disciplines, the development of archaeological cartographical critique has been surprisingly slow; a missed opportunity given that archaeology, with its vast and multifaceted experience with space and maps, can significantly contribute to the field of critical mapping. Re-mapping Archaeology thinks through cartographic challenges in archaeology and critiques the existing mapping traditions used in the social sciences and humanities, especially since the 1990s. It provides a unique archaeological perspective on cartographic theory and innovatively pulls together a wide range of mapping practices applicable to archaeology and other disciplines. This volume will be suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as for established researchers in archaeology, geography, anthropology, history, landscape studies, ethnology and sociology.","archaeological practice, alternative mappingsmaps, critical mapping, analyse spatial data, digital technologies, remapping archaeology, critical perspectives, fundamental tool"

"The Historical Significance of Textual DistancesMeasuring similarity is a basic task in information retrieval, and now often a building-block for more complex arguments about cultural change. But do measures of textual similarity and distance really correspond to evidence about cultural proximity and differentiation? To explore that question empirically, this paper compares textual and social measures of the similarities between genres of English-language fiction. Existing measures of textual similarity (cosine similarity on tf-idf vectors or topic vectors) are also compared to new strategies that use supervised learning to anchor textual measurement in a social context.","textual distancesmeasuring similarity, textual similarity, historical significance, basic task, tfidf vectors, cultural proximity, information retrieval"
"From Digital Medical Collections to Radiology Training E-Learning CoursesMedical knowledge has been growing at an exponential rate over the last years. Such growth is particularly significant in the area of radiology as the number of publications and related bibliographical sources clearly show. There are multiple digital collections that contribute to organizing knowledge regarding this area, either for clinical research or education purposes. The current work is focused on using the huge amount of medical cases available in these collections to support specific training courses, particularly addressed to medical residents who combine the practice of medicine and instruction. Such support is based on retrieving information items from these extant digital collections and generating instructional resources that can be deployed in the resident training context.

"Metropolis, apparato del Novecento. La distopia come oggettivazione delle paure urbane= Metropolis, 20th century apparatus. Dystopia as objectification of urban fearMetropolis, 20th century apparatus. Dystopia as objectification of urban fear. Metropolis (1927) by Fritz Lang represents the first urban dystopia in the history of 20th-century movies. The archetype of the city comes from cultural exchange between the representations of sci-fi literature and the scientific discoveries of the early 20th century: the vertical city by HG Wells Tales of space and time, the second industrial revolution, the so-called machine civilization, the theories of the Bauhaus and the Avant-garde. The osmosis between the hard sciences and the humanities forms a dynamic map, which is constructed by the present reality and which determines the design model of the future. But Metropolis is also a powerful representation of man, the transfiguration of the human microcosm in the urban macrocosm, a metaphor of the uncertain human ontological status. It is the dystopian model that–like Trantor by the sci-fi Foundation series of Isaac Asimov and the urban nightmares of Philip K. Dick, or like the Los Angeles of Blade Runner or the Machine City of Matrix–allows us to reflect on the present world.","metropolis, urban fear, la distopia,  machine learning, dystopia, 20th century, del novecento, 20thcentury movies, urban fearmetropolis"
"Mexico’s Tradition and Culture Entering the Digital Age: The Mexican Cultural Heritage Repository ProjectMexico is a country with a vast and extraordinary cultural heritage, which is the result of a rich history of cultural exchange, syncretism and transculturation. This rich culture has been materialized through the consolidation of a long and prestigious museum tradition, which at the same time is sadly characterized by an endemic lack of technological resources rather than professional skills. As a result, we have found that Mexican museums produce very heterogeneous forms of documentation, which are often not even managed using information technologies. Furthermore, most museums deploy ad hoc solutions that directly limit the usefulness and value of the documentation process itself. In response, the recently founded Mexican Ministry of Culture is undertaking the development of the Mexican cultural heritage data model (Modelo de Datos México), which is aimed at contributing to the cultural heritage domain of …","mexico, tradition, mexican ministry, rich history, cultural heritage, endemic lack, digital age, culture, museums, professional skills, technological resources"
"Migrating People, Migrating Data: Digital Approaches to Migrant HeritageMigrants all over the world have left multiple traces in different countries, and this cultural heritage is of growing interest to researchers and to the migrant communities themselves. Cultural heritage institutions, however, have dwindling funds and resources to meet the demand for the heritage of immigrant communities to be protected. In this article we propose that the key to bridging this gap is to be found in new possibilities that are opened up if resources are linked to enable digital exploration of archival records and collections. In particular, we focus on the value of building a composite and distributed resource around migrants’ life courses. If this approach is used and dispersed collections held by heritage institutions can be linked, migrant communities can have access to detailed information about their families and researchers to a wealth of data—serial and qualitative—for sophisticated and innovative research. Not only does the scattered data become more usable and manageable, it becomes more visible and coherent; patterns can be discovered that were not apparent before. We use the Dutch-Australian collaborative project “Migrant: Mobilities and Connection” as an example and case study of this life course–centered methodology and propose that this may develop into a migration heritage template for migrants worldwide.","people, cultural heritage, immigrant communities, cultural heritage institutions, data, multiple traces, life courses, digital approaches, migrating data, migrant communities"
"Analyzing Real-Time Multimedia Content From Network Cameras: Using CPUs and GPUs in the CloudMillions of network cameras are streaming real-time multimedia content (images or videos) for various environments (eg, highways and malls) and can be used for a variety of applications. Analyzing the content from many network cameras requires significant amounts of computing resources. Cloud vendors offer resources in the form of cloud instances with different capabilities and hourly costs. Some instances include GPUs that can accelerate analysis programs. Doing so incurs additional monetary cost because instances with GPUs are more expensive. It is a challenging problem to reduce the overall monetary cost of using the cloud to analyze the real-time multimedia content from network cameras while meeting the desired analysis frame rates. This paper describes a cloud resource manager that solves this problem by estimating the resource requirements of executing analysis programs using CPU or GPU, formulating the resource allocation problem as a multiple-choice vector bin packing problem, and solving it using an existing algorithm. The experiments show that the manager can reduce up to 61\% of the cost compared with other allocation strategies.","network cameras, analysis programs, realtime multimedia content, computing resources, additional monetary cost, content, cloud instances, cloud vendors"
"Neural Framework for Joint Evolution Modeling of User Feedback and Social Links in Dynamic Social Networks.Modeling the evolution of user feedback and social links in dynamic social networks is of considerable significance, because it is the basis of many applications, including recommendation systems and user behavior analyses. Most of the existing methods in this area model user behaviors separately and consider only certain aspects of this problem, such as dynamic preferences of users, dynamic attributes of items, evolutions of social networks, and their partial integration. This work proposes a comprehensive general neural framework with several optimal strategies to jointly model the evolution of user feedback and social links. The framework considers the dynamic user preferences, dynamic item attributes, and time-dependent social links in time-evolving social networks. Experimental results conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model performs remarkably better than state-of-the-art methods.","user feedback, area model user behaviors, considerable significance, methods, dynamic user preferences, dynamic preferences, social links, social networks, user behavior analyses, neural framework, joint evolution modeling, framework, dynamic attributes"

"Lack of evidence for substrate channeling or flux between wildtype and mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase to produce the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarateMonoallelic point mutations in the gene encoding the cytosolic, NADP+-dependent enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) cause increased production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) in multiple cancers. Most IDH1 mutant tumors retain one wildtype (WT) IDH1 allele. Several studies have proposed that retention of this WT allele is protumorigenic by facilitating substrate channeling through a WT–mutant IDH1 heterodimer, with the WT subunit generating a local supply of α-ketoglutarate and NADPH that is then consumed by the mutant subunit to produce 2-HG. Here, we confirmed that coexpression of WT and mutant IDH1 subunits leads to formation of WT–mutant hetero-oligomers and increases 2-HG production. An analysis of a recently reported crystal structure of the WT–R132H IDH1 heterodimer and of in vitro kinetic parameters for 2-HG production, however, indicated that substrate …","evidence, mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase, idh1, substrate, multiple cancers, lack"
"Conjugal homes: marriage culture in contemporary novels of the Pakistani diasporaMoreover, many novels from the Pakistani diaspora document various tropes of diasporic life from myriad perspectives that include racialism, alienation, identity crisis, acculturation, gendered Islamophobia, cultural shock, etc. Despite the intellectual nesse with which these writers present issues relating to marriage as an institution that envelops nuanced complexities for partners from disparate cultures, it has arguably not been examined as thoroughly as it might be within the frame of marriage as a recurring leitmotif in contemporary novels of the Pakistani diaspora. Our chapter expands on this theme through an extended comparative analysis of three novels by Pakistani diasporic writers: Sidhwa’s An American Brat (1993), Abidi’s Twilight (2008), and, especially, Aslam’s Maps for Lost Lovers (2004).

"Who Feels What and Why? Annotation of a Literature Corpus with Semantic Roles of EmotionsMost approaches to emotion analysis in fictional texts focus on detecting the emotion expressed in text. We argue that this is a simplification which leads to an overgeneralized interpretation of the results, as it does not take into account who experiences an emotion and why. Emotions play a crucial role in the interaction between characters and the events they are involved in. Until today, no specific corpora that capture such an interaction were available for literature. We aim at filling this gap and present a publicly available corpus based on Project Gutenberg, REMAN (Relational EMotion ANnotation), manually annotated for spans which correspond to emotion trigger phrases and entities/events in the roles of experiencers, targets, and causes of the emotion. We provide baseline results for the automatic prediction of these relational structures and show that emotion lexicons are not able to encompass the high variability of emotion expressions and demonstrate that statistical models benefit from joint modeling of emotions with its roles in all subtasks. The corpus that we provide enables future research on the recognition of emotions and associated entities in text. It supports qualitative literary studies and digital humanities.

"Metacognitive Difficulties Faced by Novice Programmers in Automated Assessment ToolsMost novice programmers are not explicitly aware of the problem-solving process used to approach programming problems and cannot articulate to an instructor where they are in that process. Many are now arguing that this skill, called metacognitive awareness, is crucial for novice learning. However, novices frequently learn in university CS1 courses that employ automated assessment tools (AATs), which are not typically designed to provide the cognitive scaffolding necessary for novices to develop metacognitive awareness. This paper reports on an experiment designed to understand what difficulties novice programmers currently face when learning to code with an AAT.

Despite the promise of many disruptive technologies for collaboration, annotation, open peer review, and the integration of multimedia, relatively few literature and humanities journals operate with these mechanisms. In December 2015, the Digital Humanities Quarterly issue 9.4,"" Comics as Scholarship"" released.

The journey to make the issue started many years before, in an informally-gathered THATCamp (a digital humanities"" unconference,"" or informal networking and collaboration-focused gathering) session of comics enthusiasts. This piece is a documentation of what happened between those two moments, told by the editors and contributor Jason Helms.Throughout this hypertext, we (as color-coded above and throughout) will share our recollections and insights into the process of crafting and editing this unusual project, which involved adapting the methods of a typically traditional manuscript-focused digital humanities journal to suit more experimental scholarly forms while still providing peer-reviewed rigor.

"Tony Harrison the Translator:“Life’sa Performance. Either Join in/Lightheartedly, or Thole the Pain”Much attention has been paid to Tony Harrison the poet and playwright, but much less to his translation activity. While there have been four substantial monographs written about him in English by Sandie Byrne, Christine Regan, Antony Rowland and Luke Spencer, no one has foregrounded the role of translation in his work. My paper will argue for the importance of his translations in his poetic career and will show how his method of translation is influenced by his poetics and ideology. While other prominent modern poet-translators, such as W. H. Auden, Robert Graves, Seamus Heaney, Ted Hughes, Paul Muldoon and W. B. Yeats have translated the classics, Harrison’s approach is distinct because he works collaboratively with directors, translates directly from the source languages and brings a forceful poetics of his own to bear upon the text.","tony harrison, substantial monographs, sandie byrne"

"Quantifying the visual concreteness of words and topics in multimodal datasetsMultimodal machine learning algorithms aim to learn visual-textual correspondences. Previous work suggests that concepts with concrete visual manifestations may be easier to learn than concepts with abstract ones. We give an algorithm for automatically computing the visual concreteness of words and topics within multimodal datasets. We apply the approach in four settings, ranging from image captions to images/text scraped from historical books. In addition to enabling explorations of concepts in multimodal datasets, our concreteness scores predict the capacity of machine learning algorithms to learn textual/visual relationships. We find that 1) concrete concepts are indeed easier to learn; 2) the large number of algorithms we consider have similar failure cases; 3) the precise positive relationship between concreteness and performance varies between datasets. We conclude with recommendations for using concreteness scores to facilitate future multimodal research.","visual relationships, multimodal datasetsmultimodal machine, multimodal datasets, visualtextual correspondences, concepts, visual concreteness, words, image captions"

"Unruly Women, Queer Objects: Analysing Object Conduct in Todd Haynes’ Carol (2015)My thesis undertakes an analysis of object conduct - the way individuals socially and personally engage with matter - in Todd Haynes’ Carol (2015), a film about a clandestine lesbian relationship in 1950’s America. Through the use of a combination of material cultures theory and queer theory, my thesis performs a close reading of the social and personal interactions that emerge from gloves and cameras in the film. Furthermore, my argument traces how the homosexual and heterosexual relationships between the characters are created, maintained, made durable or tenuous through the objects in the film. Feminist film theory and queer feminist theory provides a secondary framework to consider the temporal nuances of a film made in the present but set in the past. I locate the status of objects as more than just things, but rather multivalent transfer points, and seek to further Scott Herrings inquiry: what happens when everyday objects become deviant? This multi-disciplinary approach allows my thesis to consider the destabilizing effects of non-normative object useage has on normative categories of culture. Ultimately, my thesis shows the disruptive effect a lesbian relationship - made and maintained through gloves and a camera - can have on the patriarchal and heteronormative hegemonies of 1950’s America.","queer objects, objects, film, theory, unruly women, clandestine lesbian relationship, thesis, object conduct"
"Hedgehog/GLI1 activation leads to leukemic transformation of myelodysplastic syndrome in vivo and GLI1 inhibition results in antitumor activityMyelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are stem cell disorders with risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Gene expression profiling reveals transcriptional expression of GLI1, of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, in poor-risk MDS/AML. Using a murine model of MDS we demonstrated that constitutive Hh/Gli1 activation accelerated leukemic transformation and decreased overall survival. Hh/Gli1 activation resulted in clonal expansion of phenotypically defined granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and acquisition of self-renewal potential in a non-self-renewing progenitor compartment. Transcriptome analysis of GMPs revealed enrichment in gene signatures of self-renewal pathways, operating via direct Gli1 activation. Using human cell lines we demonstrated that in addition to canonical Hh signaling, GLI1 is activated in a Smoothened-independent manner.

"Filter and Annotate: Towards Automatic Identification of Genuine MetaphoricityNatural Language Processing has largely addressed automatic metaphor detection on grounds of (cognitive) linguistic frameworks, especially the Conceptual Metaphor Theory of Lakoff and Johnson 1, which sees metaphor as ubiquitous. In contrast, in this work we view metaphor as an exceptional phenomenon 2. This change in perspective affects applicability of machine learning approaches for metaphor detection, usage of corresponding features, as well as availability of datasets. We propose a combination of manual annotation and automatic filtering as an approach to conduct first steps into the direction of genuine metaphor detection.","filter, conceptual metaphor theory, annotate, automatic identification, linguistic frameworks, genuine metaphoricitynatural language, automatic metaphor detection"
"Introduction to the Second Workshop on Natural Language for Artificial IntelligenceNatural Language Processing plays a fundamental role in current AI research, as target of different scientific and industrial interests. At the same time, several AI achievements have shown their beneficial impact on applications in linguistic modelling, processing and generation. Especially the recent advancements in deep learning are drastically changing the landscape of NLP, where the continuous performance improvement on well established tasks is happening at an unprecedented speed. Therefore, Natural Language Processing is—still and once again—a rich research topic, whose cross-fertilization with AI spans a number of independent areas such as Cognitive Computing, Robotics as well as Human-Computer Interaction. For AI, Natural Languages are the research focus of paradigms and applications but, at the same time, they act as cornerstones of automation, autonomy and learnability for most intelligent tasks. Such tasks range from Computer Vision, to Planning and Social Behavior analysis, up to more imponderable cognitive phenomena such as creativity and human emotions. A reflection about such diverse and promising interactions is an important target for current AI studies, fully in the core mission of AI* IA. Still, we also believe this area is not only “populated” of scientific and technological challenges. In fact, we trust that at the crossroad between NLP and AI, new technological paradigms rise: the resulting methodologies and technologies can change our reality and their societal impact has not yet been fully-fledged.

"Identifying Semantic Domains Using Syntactic Logical Connectives: from corpus to conceptualizationNatural languages express how we categorize the world, reﬂecting the cognitive process of conceptualization. We wish to demonstrate how features of cognitive processes of categorization, such as identiﬁcation of semantical domains, are systematically embodied in the syntactic-semantic constructions of natural languages. We apply computational methods on large language corpora focusing on the detection of lexical entities collocated with logical operators and or. For each source lexical item, we enforce a friend-of-a-friend relation (FoF) that yields a graph structure with enhanced distributional semantic aspects. Graph algorithms for community detection identify subgraph structures that are interpreted as semantic domains of a lexeme’s polysemous conceptual matrix. From the semantic perspective, the application of community detection and centrality describe the activation of a speciﬁc lexical meaning. Moreover, the systemic perspective of the subgraph relations represents the ontological structure of domains necessary for gaining a comprehensive understanding of a single concept in that communication community. This empirical approach is generally applicable to the analysis of lexical domains in any language, as well as cross-cultural and intra-cultural commensurability. Variation is demonstrated on the example of the graph analysis of the conceptualization of lexeme feeling in English language corpora EnTenTen and comparable lexeme osjećaj in Croatian hrWac corpora.

We aim to recommend two types of routing: one is for tourist spots on a route frequently visited by large groups of tourists, and the other one is for suggesting a route with a small number of expected tourists. Our method is based on shallow processing of tweets and can be used in online applications. We demonstrate online route navigation system that recommends routes based on diversity of foreign languages spoken in two touristically popular cites: San Francisco and Kyoto.","route, traveler density, navigation system, unfamiliar cities"
"Digital HeritageNearly fifteen years have passed since UNESCO designated the ‘preservation’of digital heritage to be ‘an issue of worldwide concern’. 1 Since that time, institutions, organizations, and individuals around the globe have applied themselves in establishing standards for the creation, documentation, curation, and–crucially–interpretation of digital artefacts. Such artefacts, of course, include both digitally created (or ‘born digital’) information and materials, as well as ‘surrogate’materials and information produced through the conversion of nondigital resources into a digital format. The province of digital heritage is thus an immense and expanding one, and so it comes as little surprise that it is increasingly prevalent in the day-to-day concerns of archivists, historians, cultural practitioners, and museum and heritage professionals. 2The integration of digital resources, technologies, and methodologies in the creation and …","unesco, resources, digital heritage"
"Cysteine proteases during larval migration and development of helminths in their final hostNeglected tropical diseases caused by metazoan parasites are major public health concerns, and therefore, new methods for their control and elimination are needed. Research over the last 25 years has revealed the vital contribution of cysteine proteases to invasion of and migration by (larval) helminth parasites through host tissues, in addition to their roles in embryogenesis, molting, egg hatching, and yolk degradation. Their central function to maintaining parasite survival in the host has made them prime intervention targets for novel drugs and vaccines. This review focuses on those helminth cysteine proteases that have been functionally characterized during the varied early stages of development in the human host and embryogenesis.","larval migration, major public health concerns, host tissues, new methods, cysteine proteases, helminth parasites"
"Zooarchaeology in the era of big data: contending with interanalyst variation and best practices for contextualizing data for informed reuseNew digital publication technologies facilitate the publication of primary data and increase the ease with which archaeologists are able to share, combine, and synthesize large datasets. The research prospects that these technologies make possible are exciting, but they raise the issue of how comparable the original datasets really are. In this study we demonstrate an issue associated with many archaeological datasets: interanalyst variation. We conduct two independent analyses of one zooarchaeological assemblage and compare data. We consider the implications of the challenge interanalyst variation poses within projects and across projects. We then make recommendations for zooarchaeologists specifically, and for archaeologists more broadly, who are interested in publishing primary datasets in order to improve future understanding of these data and facilitate their reuse. These recommendations include …","big data, interanalyst variation, original datasets, research prospects, zooarchaeology, archaeologists, technologies"
"Host-associated niche metabolism controls enteric infection through fine-tuning the regulation of type 3 secretionNiche-adaptation of a bacterial pathogen hinges on the ability to recognize the complexity of signals from the environment and integrate that information with the regulation of genes critical for infection. Here we report the transcriptome of the attaching and effacing pathogen Citrobacter rodentium during infection of its natural murine host. Pathogen gene expression in vivo was heavily biased towards the virulence factor repertoire and was found to be co-ordinated uniquely in response to the host. Concordantly, we identified the host-specific induction of a metabolic pathway that overlapped with the regulation of virulence. The essential type 3 secretion system and an associated suite of distinct effectors were found to be modulated co-ordinately through a unique mechanism involving metabolism of microbiota-derived 1, 2-propanediol, which dictated the ability to colonize the host effectively. This study provides novel …","pathogen citrobacter rodentium, regulation, metabolism, infection, bacterial pathogen hinges"
"The Power of Black Girl Magic Anthems: Nicki Minaj, Beyoncé, and “Feeling Myself” as Political EmpowermentNicki Minaj and Beyoncé are two of the most successful Black women artists in today’s popular culture. They occupy a hypervisible and invisible position in Black and mainstream popular culture, and therefore exist as a crucial discursive site to understand Black girls’ self-articulation as “blackgirlmagic” at this moment. Faced with the rise of public feminist and postracial discourses presented in new digital media forms, Minaj and Beyoncé’s representations of sexualized Black femininity reimagined popular notions of race, gender, sexuality, and representation. Both women navigate sexuality and play, which allows them to promote claims to sexual autonomy, consent, and empowerment for girls. Together, they articulated blackness as arrogance, femininity as sexual confidence, and friendship as powerfully seductive in the song “Feeling Myself” (2015). We argue that the song became a #blackgirlmagic anthem for …","mainstream popular culture, power, crucial discursive site, successful black women artists, invisible position, black girl magic, popular culture, nicki minaj, political empowermentnicki minaj"
"AAV9 intracerebroventricular gene therapy improves lifespan, locomotor function and pathology in a mouse model of Niemann-Pick type C1 diseaseNiemann-Pick type C disease (NP-C) is a fatal neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder. It is caused in 95% of cases by a mutation in the NPC1 gene that encodes NPC1, an integral transmembrane protein localised to the limiting membrane of the lysosome. There is no cure for NP-C but there is a disease-modifying drug (miglustat) that slows disease progression but with associated side effects. Here, we demonstrate in a well-characterised mouse model of NP-C that a single administration of AAV-mediated gene therapy to the brain can significantly extend lifespan, improve quality of life, prevent or ameliorate neurodegeneration, reduce biochemical pathology and normalize or improve various indices of motor function. Over-expression of human NPC1 does not cause adverse effects in the brain and correctly localises to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Furthermore, we directly compare gene …","niemannpick, integral transmembrane protein, disease, effects, locomotor function, gene, mouse model, lysosomal, npc1"
"18.11. 05, Teiszen, Cross Veneration in the Medieval Islamic WorldNo symbol of Christianity is more salient than the cross. And perhaps no faith has confronted its veneration more than Islam. In Cross Veneration in the Medieval Islamic World: Christian Identity and Practice under Muslim Rule the author, Charles Tieszen, examines how the cross shaped Christian-Muslim relations, mainly in Islamic lands from the 8th-14th centuries CE (5).Tieszen focuses on Christian apologetic literature from this time in the Arabic, Syriac, Greek, and Coptic languages; he ultimately paints a detailed, nuanced and insightful portrait of an exciting but little known subject. The book achieves, in fact, more than its stated goals by first exploring both the pagan and Jewish contexts of cross veneration in Byzantine lands between the 4th-6th centuries CE. From the Byzantine heyday under emperor Julian the Apostate (d. 363), to the empires twilight in the days of hermit Gregory Palamas (d. 1359), the readers understanding of medieval cross veneration is made up of a rich literary survey and analysis spanning a millennium.","byzantine lands, 8th14th centuries ce, medieval islamic worldno, medieval islamic, teiszen, muslim rule, christian"

"“Two days we have passed with the ancients...”: a Digital Resource of Historical Travel Writings on ItalyNon-fictional travel writings are powerful sources of information for many research areas, such as art history, ethnography, geography and cultural history. By collecting several books on the same place, it is possible to study how material and cultural aspects change over time. Moreover, travel writings can give insight not only into the places and people visited by the traveller but also on his/her culture and worldviews. Despite the importance of this type of texts, digital collections of travel writings are not easy to retrieve. Texts are often not available in a format that can be straightforwardly processed by a computer, or there is no direct download of the collection, or the documents are scattered in vast digital archives. In order to overcome these limitations, we release the first version of a corpus of more than 2 millions words of historical English travel writings about Italy which we have retrieved from freely available sources (Project Gutenberg and Project Gutenberg Australia) and we make them available in a cleaned text format and in TEI-XML through the following website: https://sites. google. com/view/travelwritingsonitaly.","art history, project gutenberg, travel writings, digital collections, historical travel writings, powerful sources, italynonfictional travel writings, cultural history, digital resource"
"The Van Boven/Bassiouni Principles: An AppraisalNorm emergence is ‘the single most difficult issue to explain’ in international politics (, 261). Some constructivists have tackled it by focusing on how norms interact with other principles that govern the international system (see the ‘norm cycle’ model and also ; ). Others have treated new norms as a gradual working-out of Enlightenment ideals that are supplanting power politics (see the ‘norm spiral’ model). In this book, by contrast, I have provided a relational account of norm emergence. It is implausible, I have suggested, to ascribe it solely to the creative agency of ‘norm entrepreneurs’, who extract norms from a stable set of cultural sources, each ‘nested’ within one another. It makes more sense to understand normative shifts, and norm entrepreneurship, as products of new beliefs. These beliefs, in turn, should be understood as mutable products of ideological competition. In the rest of this book I have argued that …","international politics, norm, bassiouni principles, van boven"
"A Predictive Model for Notional Anaphora in EnglishNotional anaphors are pronouns which disagree with their antecedents grammatical categories for notional reasons, such as plural to singular agreement in:the government... they. Since such cases are rare and conflict with evidence from strictly agreeing cases (the government... it), they present a substantial challenge to both coreference resolution and referring expression generation. Using the OntoNotes corpus, this paper takes an ensemble approach to predicting English notional anaphora in context on the basis of the largest empirical data to date. In addition to state of the art prediction accuracy, the results suggest that theoretical approaches positing a plural construal at the antecedents utterance are insufficient, and that circumstances at the anaphors utterance location, as well as global factors such as genre, have a strong effect on the choice of referring expression.","expression generation, englishnotional anaphors, singular agreement, grammatical categories, notional anaphora, predictive model"

"A Structured Managerial Model for the Decision Making Process for Enhancing Building Sustainability in all Life Cycle PhasesNowadays the sustainability is one of the primary concerns worldwide, especially in the construction industry, taking into account that the buildings have a major impact on the overall energy use and greenhouse gases emissions. There are many studies focusing on particular aspects of the topic, but a holistic, interdisciplinary and long-term approach is needed in order to reconcile the competitive objectives. Starting from a literature research, the authors have formulated a decision making algorithm aiming to respond to professionals needs to apply a structured model in their daily activities. In the second part it is presented how this model can be applied, using a practical case-study–a building in the renovation phase, emphasizing how to optimize the project even when dealing with conflicting criteria.","structured managerial model, construction industry, decision making process, sustainability, life cycle phasesnowadays, enhancing building sustainability"
"New Techniques for the Digitization of Art Historical Photographic Archives-the Case of the Cini Foundation in VeniceNumerous libraries and museums hold large art historical photographic collections, numbering millions of images. Because of their non-standard format, these collections pose special challenges for digitization. This paper address these difficulties by proposing new techniques developed for the digitization of the photographic archive of the Cini Foundation. This included the creation of a custom-built circular, rotating scanner. The resulting digital images were then automatically indexed, while artificial intelligence techniques were employed in information extraction. Combined, these tools vastly sped processes which were traditionally undertaken manually, paving the way for new ways of exploring the collections.","venicenumerous libraries, new techniques, photographic archive, art historical photographic, collections, cini foundation"

Previous ORBS implementations slice a program by iteratively deleting adjacent lines of code. This paper introduces two new deletion operators based on lexical similarity. Furthermore, it presents a generalization of O RBS that can exploit multiple deletion operators: Multi-operator Observation-Based Slicing (MOBS). An empirical evaluation of MOBS using three real world Java projects finds that the use of lexical information, improves the efficiency of ORBS: MOBS can delete up to 87% of lines while taking only about 33% of the execution time with respect to the original ORBS.","lexical similarity, multioperator, mobs, observationbased slicing, lexical approximation, program"

The Chinese title Happiness belies poignant social realism. With rapid industrialization and modernization, China’s class stratification grows worse both in rural and urban environments. Jia Pingwa explores the definition of happiness and its cost through the migrant worker Happy Liu’s quest for his identity and home. The novel opens with a flashback of a police officer apprehending Hawa and investigating his real name and identity. Hawa Liu insists that the police officer address him as “Happy” Liu and claims that he is from Xi’an.

"Coverage of the Surgical Strike on Television News in India: Nationalism, journalistic discourse and India–Pakistan conflictOn 29 September 2016, the Indian army conducted a surgical strike along the India–Pakistan border. The mainstream news media in India followed the event with assertive nationalistic rhetoric. What was supposed to be a covert military operation against terrorism became morphed into political rhetoric aggravated by the unwarranted jingoism of television news channels and social media. The coverage of the strike on television news is typically characterized by a confluence of militant nationalist discourses, and the ideologically imbued labelling of specific communities. Within this context, drawing from the close reading of the coverage, this article analyses how Indian television news sustains the construction of a fictive “we”, conflated with the government policies and military strategies, and speaks for a supposedly homogeneous national consensus that also consciously obscures the dissent through minority …","coverage, pakistan border, political rhetoric, journalistic discourse, assertive nationalistic rhetoric, pakistan conflicton, mainstream news media, covert military operation, television news, indian army, surgical strike"

"An iterative method for personalized results adaptation in cross-language searchOn todays Web, people often desire to not only retrieve results which are of relevance to their query, but for those results to be of particular relevance to them as an individual. In most personalized search systems, the scores obtained from different rankers are linearly combined to provide the personalized ranked list. Moreover, when compared to the personalization research in monolingual web search, relatively few studies extend to the cross-language domain. In this paper we investigate the personalized results adaptation problem in the context of cross-language web search. The main contribution of this research is a novel iterative ranking method based on document associations obtained from an initial ranker. The method assumes that results retrieved by non-personalized rankers and personalized rankers mutually reinforce each other, rather than being used in linear combination.

"Not So Splendiferous Brussels Baroque Tapestry: Daniel Leyniers (1618–1688) RecoveredOne hundred and forty years ago, in his Les tapisseries bruxelloises—the bible of Brussels tapestry studies—Alphonse Wauters paraphrased an application for tax relief that Daniel Leyniers (1618–88) successfully submitted to the Brussels city administration in 1644. 1 The document shows that the most important tapestry producers had supported Leyniers’s application as he was “the most effective and most experienced” patroonschilder (cartoon painter/tapestry designer) in town. Though he clearly had some renown in his time, art history has all but forgotten Daniel Leyniers.

"Multidisciplinary Investigation of the Imperial Gates of the 17th Century Wooden Church in Sălișca, Cluj County, RomaniaOne of the most beautiful elements of cultural heritage in Romanian villages is the Transylvanian wooden churches. Unfortunately, these heritage elements have experienced considerable deterioration. This paper presents the results of a project whose main goal was the scientific investigation of the Imperial Gates belonging to the wooden church in Sălișca, Cluj County, Romania. To digitally preserve and document the Imperial Gates, a scientific investigation into the wooden support and the painting materials (ground, pigments) were performed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy. FTIR spectroscopy provided information about the wooden support, whereas XRF and FTIR methods were used to structurally characterize the painting materials. These structural data were correlated with the artistic, theological, and historical analysis of the religious heritage monument. Starting from the information acquired about the wooden support and the painting materials, the Imperial Gates were three-dimensional (3D) scanned using state-of-the-art laser scanners. The digitization of the Imperial Gates and the interior of the church was performed to maintain the current preservation status and disseminate this information to the public using online instruments.","heritage elements, 17th century wooden church, wooden church, wooden support, multidisciplinary investigation, cultural heritage, imperial gates, scientific investigation, cluj county, romanian villages, ftir, painting materials, transylvanian wooden churches"

He made the claim that Bennett’s systems impose a predetermined structure to place and place experience. If one assumes that phenomenology is “a return to the things themselves,” how phenomenologically can I justify Bennett’s progressive approximation? This reviewer brought forward the related question of whether phenomenology is experiential description or cerebral interpretation. Does phenomenology remain close to the phenomenon and involve mostly narrative explication arising from lived expressions of the phenomenon? Or does phenomenology move away from pure experiential description and toward an interpretive structure grounded in the phenomenon but understanding the phenomenon more broadly?

"Benchmarking API Costs of Network Sampling StrategiesOnline social media contain valuable quantitative and qualitative data, necessary to advance complex social systems studies. However, these data vaults are often behind a wall: the owners of the media sites dictate what, when, and how much data can be collected via a mandatory interface (called Application Program Interface: API). To work with such restrictions, network scientists have designed sampling methods, which do not require a full crawl of the data to obtain a representative picture of the underlying social network. However, such sampling methods are usually evaluated only on one dimension: what strategy allows for the extraction of a sample whose statistical properties are closest to the original network? In this paper we go beyond this view, by creating a benchmark that tests the performance of a method in a multifaceted way. When evaluating a network sampling algorithm, we take into account the …","qualitative data, data vaults, network sampling"

We begin with a writer» s narrative that presumably can be supported with visual data evidence. We leverage natural language processing, quantitative narrative analysis, and information visualization to (1) automatically extract narrative components (who, what, when, where) from data-rich stories, and (2) integrate the supporting data evidence with the text to develop a narrative visualization.

Map Change Prediction for Quality AssuranceOpen geospatial datasources like OpenStreetMap are created by a community of mappers of different experience and with different equipment available. It is therefore important to assess the quality of Open-StreetMap-like maps to give recommendations for users in which situations a map is suitable for their needs. In this work we want to use already defined ways to assess the quality of geospatial data and apply them to a Machine Learning algorithm to classify which areas are likely to change in future revisions of the map. In a next step we intend to qualify the changes detected by the algorithm and try to find causes of the changes being tracked.,"machine learning algorithm, openstreetmaplike maps, map, assuranceopen geospatial, geospatial data, future revisions"
"Extracting Keywords from Open-Ended Business Survey QuestionsOpen-ended survey data constitute an important basis in research as well as for making business decisions. Collecting and manually analysing free-text survey data is generally more costly than collecting and analysing survey data consisting of answers to multiple-choice questions. Yet free-text data allow for new content to be expressed beyond predefined categories and are a very valuable source of new insights into peoples opinions. At the same time, surveys always make ontological assumptions about the nature of the entities that are researched, and this has vital ethical consequences. Human interpretations and opinions can only be properly ascertained in their richness using textual data sources; if these sources are analyzed appropriately, the essential linguistic nature of humans and social entities is safeguarded. Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers possibilities for meeting this ethical business challenge by automating the analysis of natural language and thus allowing for insightful investigations of human judgements. We present a computational pipeline for analysing large amounts of responses to open-ended questions in surveys and extract keywords that appropriately represent peoples opinions. This pipeline addresses the need to perform such tasks outside the scope of both commercial software and bespoke analysis, exceeds the performance to state-of-the-art systems, and performs this task in a transparent way that allows for scrutinising and exposing potential biases in the analysis. Following the principle of Open Data Science, our code is open-source and generalizable to other datasets.","predefined categories, survey data, vital ethical consequences, new content, important basis, business decisions, freetext data"

"When you are your computer: The future of embodied computingOur devices are changing the way we think of ourselves as selves. We produce, share, and publicize our very personal data on a daily basis. Algorithms are personal–they make decisions for us, filter what we read, inform what we buy (or think of buying), map our whereabouts, and remember faces of people we know. Increasingly, thoughts, desires, memories, fears, and anxieties will be “read” by digital sensors and computers on, in, and around the body. The influence of algorithms will grow; we can expect digital lifestyle to undergo exponential transformation. The research and advisory company Gartner predicts that “by 2021, AI artificial intelligence will support more than 80% of emerging technologies.” 1Today we can ask our digital home assistant, Apple’s Siri, or even our companion robot to help us find the perfect beach vacation. In the future, we predict, we will simply think about holidays to Hawai ‘i and they will become reality; thinking, feeling, or remembering will amount to asking. When we suffer ailments now, we search for medical help online; in the future, our bodies will simply be scanned in our homes. Now we circulate political news amongst friends across social media; in the future, our political leanings will be conveyed through various cognitive reactions read by sensors. Discursive prediction amounts to an implicit and even celebrated belief that we are on a course to becoming","personal data, exponential transformation, digital sensors, future, daily basis"
"Survey of Computational Approaches to Diachronic Conceptual ChangeOur languages are in constant flux driven by external factors such as cultural, societal and technological changes, as well as by only partially understood internal motivations. Words acquire new meanings and lose old senses, new words are coined or borrowed from other languages and obsolete words slide into obscurity. Understanding the characteristics of shifts in the meaning and in the use of words is useful for those who work with the content of historical texts, the interested general public, but also in and of itself. The findings from automatic lexical semantic change detection, and the models of diachronic conceptual change are currently being incorporated in approaches for measuring document across-time similarity, information retrieval from long-term document archives, the design of OCR algorithms, and so on. In recent years we have seen a surge in interest in the academic community in computational methods and tools supporting inquiry into diachronic conceptual change and lexical replacement. This article is an extract of a survey of recent computational techniques to tackle lexical semantic change currently under review. In this article we focus on diachronic conceptual change as an extension of semantic change.","approaches, computational approaches, conceptual changeour languages, survey, constant flux"
"16. IN THE WAKE OF THE QUAKEOur starting point is the expensive brochure for Auckland City’s ‘Learning Quarter,’the Learning Quarter Plan 2009 (Auckland City, 2009). Progress, potential, openness, discovery: these are the four ‘key platforms’ that mark the strategy outlined in the Plan for this so-called ‘place of enlightenment’(Auckland City, 2009, pp. 1, 4) that comprises AUT University, the University of Auckland, and environs. The Plan is a statement of what we have called elsewhere ‘built pedagogy’(Sturm & Turner, 2011). It represents the ‘entrepreneurial ecosystem’(Barton, 2008) of the University of Auckland’s Business School writ large in order to teach all those who visit the Quarter, physically or virtually, the value (s) of entrepreneurial education, of innovation in action. 1 The Learning Quarter thus aspires to both urban and economic renewal, to ‘sustainable’–if not liveable–transformation (Auckland City, 2009, p. 19). Sustainability, of course, tends to mean ‘securitization’(Buzan, Wæver, & de Wilde, 1998, p. 23): the development of projects that aim not only to beautify city spaces in the guise of environmental sustainability, but also to secure a risk-free return on investment in the name of economic sustainability (existential security seldom comes into its calculations). It is securitization that drives the aesthetic transformation of built spaces under global techno-capitalism, or ‘transcendental capitalism’(de Cauter, 2002, p. 273). 2What the Learning Quarter Plan does not do, because it is thoroughly ‘probabilist,’or risk-averse, is help its inhabitants develop a sense of the larger problems at hand, of which the banking sector’s implication in the global financial crisis was not the …","wake, auckland city, expensive brochure, aut university, plan, university, learning quarter plan"

"The Transformation of Gender in English-Language FictionOver the last 170 years, the roles of masculine and feminine characters have become less sharply distinct. In the middle of the nineteenth century, it is relatively easy to identify a characters grammatical gender, just by looking at their actions and attributes in the story; it becomes steadily more difficult as we move toward the present. But the diminishing power of stereotypes, interestingly, does not parallel progress toward equality of representation. On the contrary, from 1850 to 1950, women lose almost half the space they had occupied in fiction. Attention is distributed less equally, even though roles are becoming more flexible. This presents literary historians with a striking paradox; a few potential explanations are considered.  Data and code supporting this argument are available at https://github.com/tedunderwood/character, and also archived more permanently in the Cultural Analytics Dataverse.","feminine characters, englishlanguage fictionover, roles, transformation"
"Continuous Integration and Unit Testing of Digital EditionsOver the last few years, the Perseus Digital Library (PDL) and the Open Philology Project (OPP) have been moving towards enabling better interoperability and citability of their texts by implementing the Canonical Text Services URN standard and the Epidoc subset of the TEI P5 guidelines. This is a resource-intensive effort necessitating a scalable workflow centered on continuous curation of these texts, from both within and outside the PDL/OPP ecosystem. Key requirements for such a workflow are ease of maintenance and speed of deployment of texts for use by a wide variety of analytical services and user interfaces. Drawing on software engineering best practices, we have designed an architecture meant for continuous integration with customizable services that test individual files upon each contribution made to our public git repositories. The services can be configured to test and report status on a variety of checkpoints from schema compliance to CTS-ready markup designed for flexibility and interoperability.","interoperability, services, resourceintensive effort, tei p5 guidelines, opp, continuous integration, epidoc subset, scalable workflow, unit testing, digital editionsover, open philology project, perseus digital library"
"Wearable proximity sensors for monitoring a mass casualty incident exercise: a feasibility studyOver the past several decades, naturally occurring and man-made mass casualty incidents (MCI) have increased in frequency and number, worldwide. To test the impact of such event on medical resources, simulations can provide a safe, controlled setting while replicating the chaotic environment typical of an actual disaster. A standardised method to collect and analyse data from mass casualty exercises is needed, in order to assess preparedness and performance of the healthcare staff involved. We report on the use of wearable proximity sensors to measure proximity events during a MCI simulation. We investigated the interactions between medical staff and patients, to evaluate the time dedicated by the medical staff with respect to the severity of the injury of the victims depending on the roles. We estimated the presence of the patients in the different spaces of the field hospital, in order to study the patients flow. Data were obtained and collected through the deployment of wearable proximity sensors during a mass casualty incident functional exercise. The scenario included two areas: the accident site and the Advanced Medical Post (AMP), and the exercise lasted 3 hours. A total of 238 participants simulating medical staff and victims were involved. Each participant wore a proximity sensor and 30 fixed devices were placed in the field hospital. The contact networks show a heterogeneous distribution of the cumulative time spent in proximity by participants. We obtained contact matrices based on cumulative time spent in proximity between victims and the rescuers. Our results showed that the time spent in proximity by the healthcare teams with …","wearable proximity sensors, mass casualty incidents, medical staff, medical resources, mass casualty incident exercise"
"Common Data and Technological Partnership-The Foundation for the Development of Smart Cities-Poznań Case StudyOver the recent years communities have been working towards changing the paradigm of city development into the so-called smart approaches. While various revolutionary solutions have been deployed to make the cities smarter, we believe that a more evolutionary path makes it easier for the cities to change into smart ecosystems. Such an evolutionary path is possible with the right foundation. In this paper we discuss such a foundation that has been making the city of Poznań, Poland, smarter over the last 20 years, and opens opportunities for employing the Citizen Science model of smart city development. This foundation relates to the combination of the creation of a common data space, and the technological partnership with a research and development center and research cyberinfrastructure operator such as the Poznań Supercomputing and Networking Center.","city development, smart, common data, technological partnershipthe foundation"

"The Nietzschean self: moral psychology, agency, and the unconsciousPaul KatsafanasL The Nietzschean Self: Moral Psychology, Agency, and the Unconscious marks a consolidation of half a century of Anglophone Nietzsche scholarship. Whereas previous commentators have often been mesmerized and distracted by NietzscheLs italicized phrases (amor fati, ressentiment, pathos of distance), Katsafanas focuses on the less flashy but more essential components of his moral psychology: consciousness and the unconscious, drives, values, willing, the self and freedom. The book is organized into eight main chapters bookended by a succinct introduction and a comparison with the moral psychologies of Kant, Hume and Aristotle. Along the way, Katsafanas engages illuminatingly with both contemporary philosophical work and NietzscheLs intellectual predecessors and successors.In two chapters on consciousness and the unconscious, Katsafanas argues that Nietzsche aligns the …","moral psychology, anglophone nietzsche scholarship, amor fati"
"Music Emotion Capture: sonifying emotions in EEG dataPeople’s emotions are not always obviously detectable, due to difficulties expressing emotions, or geographic distance (eg if people are communicating online). There are also many occasions where it would be useful for a computer to be able to detect users’ emotions and respond to them appropriately. A person’s brain activity gives vital clues as to emotions they are experiencing at any one time. The aim of this project is to detect, model and sonify people’s emotions. To achieve this, there are two tasks:(1) to detect emotions based on current brain activity as measured by an EEG device;(2) to play appropriate music in real-time, representing the current emotional state of the user. Here we report a pilot study implementing the Music Emotion Capture system. In future work we plan to improve how this project performs emotion detection through EEG, and to generate new music based on emotion-based characteristics of music. Potential applications arise in collaborative/assistive software and brain-computer interfaces for non-verbal communication.","geographic distance, emotion, brain, eeg datapeople, music emotion capture, vital clues"

"Predicting demographics, moral foundations, and human values from digital behavioursPersonal electronic devices including smartphones give access to behavioural signals that can be used to learn about the characteristics and preferences of individuals. In this study, we explore the connection between demographic and psychological attributes and the digital behavioural records, for a cohort of 7633 people, closely representative of the US population with respect to gender, age, geographical distribution, education, and income. Along with the demographic data, we collected self-reported assessments on validated psychometric questionnaires for moral traits and basic human values, and combined this information with passively collected multi-modal digital data from web browsing behaviour and smartphone usage. A machine learning framework was then designed to infer both the demographic and psychological attributes from the behavioural data.

"12 The edges of (African) philosophyPhilosophy instinctively explores its edges. Those edges may be the interrogation of its own beginning, source, or impetus; they may be its boundaries or demarcations from other human activities, rational or otherwise; or they may be its questions of applicability, practice or practicality–what does philosophy produce and how does it engage its world? Socrates’ daemon, Plato’s khora, Kant’s noumenal, Husserl’s lifeworld, Freud’s unconscious, Wittgenstein’s unspeakable, Oruka’s sage, and Mudimbe’s line–in different ways these and many more are the edges of what is or can be thought and what is or remains unthought. While we can identify different modes, practices, and traditions of philosophy, the investigation of edges seems to be a common feature of all.My goal here is to describe an African philosophy that does not take as its starting point or seek to gain its permission for existence from other traditions of philosophy. Even putting it this way is inexact–I will be questioning the idea of a tradition of philosophy itself, and how it has come to be an organizing and ordering device that makes sense of the philosophical world for philosophers. Western philosophers have this longstanding and, I think, problematic distinction between analytic and continental philosophy, and after that distinction is made, we add African philosophy to this as if it is another style, flavor, or type of philosophy. Perhaps, we think, it is a regional variation, and all the weaker for it, just as the art world has often reacted with suspicion toward regional art. Clearly these are not different things of the same sort, different members of a set, but as soon as we say that, we inevitably …","edges, philosophy, philosophical world, regional variation"
"Cross-referencing social media and public surveillance camera data for disaster responsePhysical media (like surveillance cameras) and social media (like Instagram and Twitter) may both be useful in attaining on-the-ground information during an emergency or disaster situation. However, the intersection and reliability of both surveillance cameras and social media during a natural disaster are not fully understood. To address this gap, we tested whether social media is of utility when physical surveillance cameras went off-line during Hurricane Irma in 2017. Specifically, we collected and compared geo-tagged Instagram and Twitter posts in the state of Florida during times and in areas where public surveillance cameras went off-line. We report social media content and frequency and content to determine the utility for emergency managers or first responders during a natural disaster.","disaster, twitter, emergency, public surveillance camera data, surveillance cameras, social media, ontheground information"
"The Power of Shape: How Shape of Node-Link Diagrams Impacts Aesthetic Appreciation and Triggers InterestPositive effects of aesthetically appreciated designs have long been studied and confirmed since the 19th century: such designs are more enjoyable, they are more forgivable for glitches and can increase users’ performance. In the field of information visualization, studies of aesthetics are still a niche approach. In the current study, we aim to specifically understand which parameters in a visualization of node-link diagrams make them aesthetically pleasing-an important extension to already existing research on usability and readability aspects. We investigated how the shape of the outline of such diagrams influences the aesthetic judgments on two of the most important dimensions of aesthetic appeal: beauty and interest. We employed different outlines to node-link diagrams and compared them with uniformly filled shapes, varying two important variables typically impacting aesthetics: complexity and curvature.

"Empire and Scholarly Communications. Multinational Monopolies of Knowledge and the Global SouthPoster presented at The 22nd International Conference on Electronic Publishing, Toronto, Canada, Saturday, June 23 2018. Publicly-funded knowledge is, indeed, a common good, and at odds with the all-encompassing for-profit ambitions of information and analytics conglomerates. We argue that universities, researchers and scholarly publishers in the Global South, and from all over the world, also have a responsibility to think critically about the interests of for-profit third-parties. It is crucial that researchers, as key participants and stakeholders in scholarly communications, retain control over how their research is conducted and disseminated.","22nd international conference, allencompassing forprofit ambitions, multinational monopolies, empire, scholarly communications, global southposter"
"The Transformation of Gender in English-Language FictionPreprint to appear in a special issue of Cultural Analytics on"" Identity."" The article explores the paradox that the representation of gender in fiction became more flexible while the sheer balance of attention between fictional men and women was growing more unequal. We measure the rigidity of gendered roles by asking how easy it is to infer grammatical gender from ostensibly ungendered words used in characterization. In the nineteenth century, roles are so predictable that the inference is easy; it becomes harder as we move toward the present. But the diminishing power of stereotypes does not parallel progress toward equality of representation. On the contrary, by the middle of the twentieth century, women have lost almost half the space they occupied in nineteenth-century fiction. The tension between growing flexibility and growing inequality of representation presents literary historians with a striking paradox; a few potential explanations are considered.Notes: This is a preprint of an article to appear in Cultural Analytics (February 2018). Data and code supporting this argument are available at https://github. com/tedunderwood/character.

"Reuse Remix Recycle: Repurposing Archaeological Digital DataPreservation of digital data is predicated on the expectation of its reuse, yet that expectation has never been examined within archaeology. While we have extensive digital archives equipped to share data, evidence of reuse seems paradoxically limited. Most archaeological discussions have focused on data management and preservation and on disciplinary practices surrounding archiving and sharing data. This article addresses the reuse side of the data equation through a series of linked questions: What is the evidence for reuse, what constitutes reuse, what are the motivations for reuse, and what makes some data more suitable for reuse than others? It concludes by posing a series of questions aimed at better understanding our digital engagement with archaeological data.","reuse remix recycle, digital data, data, archaeological digital datapreservation"
"Effects of personal characteristics on music recommender systems with different levels of controllabilityPrevious research has found that enabling users to control the recommendation process increases user satisfaction. However, providing additional controls also increases cognitive load, and different users have different needs for control. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the effect of two personal characteristics: musical sophistication and visual memory capacity. We designed a visual user interface, on top of a commercial music recommender, with different controls: interactions with recommendations (ie, the output of a recommender system), the user profile (ie, the top listened songs), and algorithm parameters (ie, weights in an algorithm). We created eight experimental settings with combinations of these three user controls and conducted a between-subjects study (N= 240), to explore the effect on cognitive load and recommendation acceptance for different personal characteristics.

"Normalized Dependency Distance: Proposing a New MeasurePrevious studies of dependency distance as a measure of, or a proxy for, syntactic complexity do not consider factors such as sentence length and root distance. In the present study, we propose a new algorithm, i.e. Normalized Dependency Distance (NDD), that takes sentence length and root distance into consideration. Our analysis showed that exponential distribution fit well the distribution model of NDD as it did with Mean Dependency Distance (MDD), the algorithm used in previous studies. Findings indicated that NDD is significantly less dependent on sentence length than MDD is, which suggests that the new algorithm may have, to some extent, addressed the issue of MDD’s dependency on sentence length. It is argued that NDD may serve as a measure of syntactic complexity, which is a kind of universality limited by the capacity of human working memory.","sentence length, syntactic complexity, exponential distribution, root distance, dependency distance, new algorithm"
"Image Provenance Analysis at ScalePrior art has shown it is possible to estimate, through image processing and computer vision techniques, the types and parameters of transformations that have been applied to the content of individual images to obtain new images. Given a large corpus of images and a query image, an interesting further step is to retrieve the set of original images whose content is present in the query image, as well as the detailed sequences of transformations that yield the query image given the original images. This is a problem that recently has received the name of image provenance analysis. In these times of public media manipulation (eg, fake news and meme sharing), obtaining the history of image transformations is relevant for fact checking and authorship verification, among many other applications. This article presents an end-to-end processing pipeline for image provenance analysis, which works at real-world scale. It employs a cutting-edge image filtering solution that is custom-tailored for the problem at hand, as well as novel techniques for obtaining the provenance graph that expresses how the images, as nodes, are ancestrally connected. A comprehensive set of experiments for each stage of the pipeline is provided, comparing the proposed solution with state-of-the-art results, employing previously published datasets. In addition, this work introduces a new dataset of real-world provenance cases from the social media site Reddit, along with baseline results.","computer vision techniques, images, image provenance, scaleprior art, endtoend processing pipeline"

In all, 192 undergraduate students were recruited and randomly assigned into 48 four‐person groups with gender being the matching variable (i.e., each group consisted of four same‐gender participants). During the decision‐making processes, some groups were asked to take notes while reading task materials and had their notes available in the following group discussion, while the other groups were not given this opportunity.

"Advanced documentation methods in studying Corinthian black-figure vase paintingProfile-drawings and tracings are essential elements of a throughout scientific object documentation in archaeological pottery studies. Within the study of Greek pottery, unwrappings of painted surfaces have a long tradition and a still well-deserved high significance. They show the depiction without photographic distortions or sectioning, enabling archaeologists to analyse and interpret the image as a whole. This is especially true in the case of Corinthian pottery, where the poor preservation of the painting tending to flake off often results in unclear photographs. Nevertheless, traces of flaked off painting layers are still visible on the surface under specific illumination. Creating profile-drawings and unwrappings manually is time-consuming. Manual acquisition with tactile tools like lead wires, profile combs or tracing paper is often not allowed due to the fragile nature of the surfaces. To facilitate this task for pottery archaeologists, we propose a combination of 3D data derived by photogrammetry (SfM) and computed tomography (CT), where each technique can also be on its own. The fusion of different data sources is a new approach. It exploits the specific strengths of these not-contact digitisation technologies: SfM with a high resolution in texture and CT with a high accuracy in geometry as well as with the added value of providing inner surfaces of closed vessels. Having SfM and CT data, we can combine them by transferring colour information to the vertices of the CT model. Afterwards, we use the GigaMesh Software Framework for enhancing geometric features in the surface data, in our case the fine incisions of the black-figure style. Doing this, we …","advanced documentation methods, corinthian blackfigure vase paintingprofiledrawings, high significance, photographic distortions, essential elements, greek pottery"
"Natural Language Processing and Network Visualization for PhilosophersProgress in philosophy is difficult to achieve because our methods are evidentially and rhetorically weak (Chalmers 2015). In the last two decades, experimental philosophers have begun to employ the methods of the social sciences to address philosophical questions (eg Weinberg et al. 2001; Nichols and Knobe 2007; Schwitzgebel and Cushman 2012). However, the adequacy of these methods has been called into question by repeated failures of replication (Open Science Collaboration 2015). In the next decade, experimental philosophers need to incorporate more robust methods to achieve a multimodal perspective. In this chapter, we explain and showcase exemplars of a promising methodology for experimental and empirical philosophy: network analysis and visualization.Networks dominate contemporary technologies such as the Internet, social media, so-called ‘smart’cities and ports, blockchain cryptocurrencies and many others. In psychological science, constructs as diverse as the neuronal structure of the brain (Raichle 2015), pathologies and disorders (Borsboom and Cramer 2013), personality factors (Epskamp et al. 2012) and belief systems have been successfully modelled as networks (Brandt et al. 2018). In humanistic studies of novels and other literature, researchers employing digital humanities methods have analysed texts and whole corpora (Moretti 2013; Alfano and Stauffer 2015). Yet these methodological tools have been employed sparingly in philosophy.

"A systematic assessment of “Axial Age” proposals using global comparative historical evidenceProponents of the Axial Age contend that parallel cultural developments between 800 and 200 BCE in what is today China, Greece, India, Iran, and Israel-Palestine constitute the global historical turning point toward modernity. The Axial Age concept is well-known and influential, but deficiencies in the historical evidence and sociological analysis available have thwarted efforts to evaluate the concept’s major global contentions. As a result, the Axial Age concept remains controversial. Seshat: Global History Databank provides new tools for examining this topic in social formations across Afro-Eurasia during the first two millennia BCE and first millennium CE, allowing scholars to empirically evaluate the varied and contrasting claims researchers have put forward. Results undercut the notion of a specific “age” of axiality limited to a specific geo-temporal localization.

"Public Perceptions on Organised Crime, Mafia, and Terrorism: A Big Data Analysis based on Twitter and Google Trends.Public perceptions enable crime and motivate government policy on law and order; however, there has been limited empirical research on serious crime perceptions in social media. Recently, open source data—and ‘big data’—have enabled researchers from different fields to develop cost-effective methods for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. Against this backdrop, the aim of this paper is to apply state-of-the-art tools and techniques for assembly and analysis of open source data. We set out to explore how non-discursive behavioural data can be used as a proxy for studying public perceptions of serious crime. The data collection focused on the following three conversational topics: organised crime, the mafia, and terrorism. Specifically, time series data of users’ online search habits (over a ten-year period) were gathered from Google Trends, and cross-sectional network data (N= 178,513) were collected from Twitter. The collected data contained a significant amount of structure. Marked similarities and differences in people’s habits and perceptions were observable, and these were recorded. The results indicated that ‘big data’is a cost-effective method for exploring theoretical and empirical issues vis-à-vis public perceptions of serious crime. ________________________________________________________________________","google trends, open source data, public perceptions, big data analysis, organised crime"

"Digital Humanists’ Knowledge Space: a Conceptual DesignPurpose–The purpose of this paper is to propose a conceptual design of a virtual knowledge space for use by digital humanists. Digital humanists’ work lies at the crossroads of computer science and the humanities (Stanford Humanities Center, 2017). Moving traditional humanistic material into digital forms brings new challenges for scholars of the humanities. The proposed virtual knowledge space is intended to help users make humanistic knowledge in digital media more manageable and usable.Design/methodology/approach–A knowledge management (KM) approach suggested by Handzic (2004) was used as a theoretical basis for designing the structure of the proposed knowledge space. According to KM, a virtual knowledge space should provide support for knowledge codification and personalisation. It should also support knowledge exploration and exploitation. Following these KM principles, the proposed design incorporates the ability to build and access knowledge repositories (eg digital documents, images, metadata), tools for knowledge discovery and presentation (eg data mining, topic modelling, visualisation), support for knowledge sharing and collaboration with other researchers (eg email, wikis, virtual meeting rooms), as well as for new knowledge creation (eg simulation games, mind mapping, brainstorming).Originality/value–This paper contributes a novel conceptual design of a virtual knowledge space that pushes forward the current state-of-the art in digital humanities. It integrates all relevant digital assets, services and tools that support the user experience. It is envisaged as a one-stop shop for humanities scholars in the …","digital, knowledge space, humanities"
"Effective searching of RDF knowledge graphsRDF knowledge graphs are typically searched using triple-pattern queries. Often, triple-pattern queries will return too many or too few results, making it difficult for users to find relevant answers to their information needs. To remedy this, we propose a general framework for effective searching of RDF knowledge graphs. Our framework extends both the searched knowledge graph and triple-pattern queries with keywords to allow users to form a wider range of queries. In addition, it provides result ranking based on statistical machine translation, and performs automatic query relaxation to improve query recall. Finally, we also define a notion of result diversity in the setting of RDF data and provide mechanisms to diversify RDF search results using Maximal Marginal Relevance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our retrieval framework using various carefully-designed user studies on DBpedia, a large and real-world RDF …","effective searching, knowledge graph, relevant answers, rdf knowledge, triplepattern queries, rdf"

"From Distracted to Recursive Reading: Facilitating Knowledge Transfer through Annotation Software.Rather than seeing hypertext as offering only distracted reading, this paper argues that annotation software provides students with the opportunity to perform recursive reading: a process that facilitates knowledge transfer and encourages intersectional critical approaches to texts. As hypertext editions and online reading communities have proliferated, scholars have theorized that these layered, interactive modes of reading produce distracted readings of texts, especially in pedagogical contexts. With annotation software, however, researchers and students have the opportunity not just to consume these distracted readings, but to produce them. Within the classroom, annotation software assignments require a deeper psychological investment from students than simply consuming a hypertext edition. By choosing how and where to annotate a particular text, students distributed modes of attention are re-focused on the …","online reading communities, recursive reading, knowledge transfer, annotation software, distracted reading, pedagogical contexts, interactive modes, hypertext editions, intersectional critical approaches, deeper psychological investment, students, annotation software assignments"
"The Origins of Electronic Literature as Net/Web ArtReaders of this chapter might benefit from the knowledge that ‘electronic literature’(or e-lit) refers to born-digital works which embrace the creative, as opposed to just the disseminative, potential of computation. As defined by Hayles:‘Electronic literature, generally considered to exclude print literature that has been digitized, is by contrast “digital born,” a first-generation digital object created on a computer and (usually) meant to be read on a computer’(2008: 3). A useful primer for those looking to develop some perquisite understanding might be ‘Electronic Literature: Contexts & Poetics’, wherein Heckman and O’Sullivan argue that e-lit can take many forms, but ‘could only exist in that space for which it was developed/written/coded’(2018). Electronic literature (or e-lit) did not start with the Web–works of art merging the literary with the digital had found their way into circulation long before the Net had permeated public consciousness and consumptive habits to the extent that we know it in contemporary contexts. It is difficult to point with any certainty to the first work of electronic literature, though many commentators attribute this accolade to Christopher Strachey, who, in 1952, designed an algorithm on the University of Manchester’s Ferranti Mark I capable of generating love letters (Wardrip-Fruin, 2008: 163). Literary experiments like Strachey’s predate what we now consider ‘the Internet’by some 30 years, and indeed even conceptual precursors like Ted Nelson’s Project Xanadu, introduced in 1960, and computer poetry like Alison Knowles and James Tenney’s The House of Dust, produced on a Siemens 4004 computer with Fortran in 1967, by the …","elit, web, web artreaders, net, electronic literature, origins"

"Visual Graphs from Motion (VGfM): Scene understanding with object geometry reasoningRecent approaches on visual scene understanding attempt to build a scene graph--a computational representation of objects and their pairwise relationships. Such rich semantic representation is very appealing, yet difficult to obtain from a single image, especially when considering complex spatial arrangements in the scene. Differently, an image sequence conveys useful information using the multi-view geometric relations arising from camera motion. Indeed, in such cases, object relationships are naturally related to the 3D scene structure. To this end, this paper proposes a system that first computes the geometrical location of objects in a generic scene and then efficiently constructs scene graphs from video by embedding such geometrical reasoning. Such compelling representation is obtained using a new model where geometric and visual features are merged using an RNN framework. We report results on a dataset we created for the task of 3D scene graph generation in multiple views.","object relationships, representation, visual graphs, camera motion, scene understanding, motion, object geometry reasoningrecent, geometric, image"
"Data management in anthropology: the next phase in ethics governance?Recent demands for accountability in ‘data management’ by funding agencies, universities, international journals and other academic institutions have worried many anthropologists and ethnographers. While their demands for transparency and integrity in opening up data for scrutiny seem to enhance scientific integrity, such principles do not always consider the way the social relationships of research are properly maintained. As a springboard, the present Forum, triggered by such recent demands to account for the use of ‘data’, discusses the present state of anthropological research and academic ethics/integrity in a broader perspective. It specifically gives voice to our disciplinary concerns and leads to a principled statement that clarifies a particularly ethnographic position. This position is then discussed by several commentators who treat its viability and necessity against the background of wider developments …","academic ethics, funding agencies, demands, data, data management, international journals"
"History Playground: A Tool for Discovering Temporal Trends in Massive Textual CorporaRecent studies have shown that macroscopic patterns of continuity and change over the course of centuries can be detected through the analysis of time series extracted from massive textual corpora. Similar data-driven approaches have already revolutionised the natural sciences, and are widely believed to hold similar potential for the humanities and social sciences, driven by the mass-digitisation projects that are currently under way, and coupled with the ever-increasing number of documents which are"" born digital"". As such, new interactive tools are required to discover and extract macroscopic patterns from these vast quantities of textual data. Here we present History Playground, an interactive web-based tool for discovering trends in massive textual corpora. The tool makes use of scalable algorithms to first extract trends from textual corpora, before making them available for real-time search and discovery, presenting users with an interface to explore the data. Included in the tool are algorithms for standardization, regression, change-point detection in the relative frequencies of ngrams, multi-term indices and comparison of trends across different corpora.Subjects: Computation and Language (cs.

"Reducing inflammation through delivery of lentivirus encoding for anti-inflammatory cytokines attenuates neuropathic pain after spinal cord injuryRecently, many clinical trials have challenged the efficacy of current therapeutics for neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury (SCI) due to their life-threatening side-effects including addictions. Growing evidence suggests that persistent inflammatory responses after primary SCI lead to an imbalance between anti-inflammation and pro-inflammation, resulting in pathogenesis and maintenance of neuropathic pain. Conversely, a variety of data suggest that inflammation contributes to regeneration. Herein, we investigated long-term local immunomodulation using anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 or IL-4-encoding lentivirus delivered from multichannel bridges. Multichannel bridges provide guidance for axonal outgrowth and act as delivery vehicles. Anti-inflammatory cytokines were hypothesized to modulate the pro-nociceptive inflammatory niche and promote axonal regeneration, leading to neuropathic pain attenuation …","spinal cord, persistent inflammatory responses, spinal cord injury, inflammation, antiinflammatory cytokines, lentivirus encoding, neuropathic pain, sci"

"Cross-Language Record Linkage based on Semantic Matching of MetadataRecord linkage is finding record pairs that refer to the same entities or objects across multiple data sources. This task is crucial in various research fields, such as federated search and data integration. This article focuses on the new challenge of cross-language record linkage, where records are from data sources in different languages. To compare the records in different languages, the records’ metadata needs to be translated from a source language to a target language. This causes mismatches between the translated metadata and the metadata in the target language, since similar meanings are sometimes expressed by different words during translation. Thus, conventional string-based similarity metrics are insufficient for measuring the similarities between the translated metadata and the metadata in the target language. Therefore, we propose a method of dealing with the mismatching problem in cross-language record linkage. For each translated metadata of the source language, first, we use a string-based similarity metric to identify the potential matching metadata in the target language as candidates. Then, we employ word embeddings to perform the semantic matching between the translated metadata and its candidate matching metadata in the target language. Our method is evaluated on a real-world dataset in Japanese and English. Our experiments proved that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods that only rely on string similarities or the semantic matching method.","data integration, record linkage, semantic matching, multiple data sources, target language, data sources, source language"
"Tillage Intensity and Conservation Cropping in the United StatesReducing tillage and increasing soil cover can enhance soil health. Conservation tillage, particularly no-till or strip-till, used in conjunction with soil cover practices (like conservation crop rotations and cover crops) can lead to a range of soil health benefits: improved agricultural productivity, greater drought resilience, and better environmental outcomes. This report uses field-level data to estimate tillage practice adoption based on soil disturbance as measured by absence of tillage operations (for no-till) and the Soil Tillage Intensity Rating (STIR, for mulch till). To gauge the intensity of tillage over time, we estimate the number of years no-till or strip-till are used over a 4-year period. Rates of adoption for practices that affect soil cover—including conservation crop rotations, cover crops, double cropping, fallowing, and residue harvest or grazing—are also estimated. The rates at which these practices are adopted in conjunction with no-till/strip-till are also estimated to illustrate interactions between tillage and practices that affect soil cover.","conservation crop, tillage intensity, soil health, conservation tillage, soil cover, united statesreducing tillage"

"Scaling Research Data Management Services Along the Maturity Spectrum: Three Institutional PerspectivesResearch data services promise to advance many academic libraries’ strategic goals of becoming partners in the research process and integrating library services with modern research workflows. Academic librarians are well positioned to make an impact in this space due to their expertise in managing, curating, and preserving digital information, and a history of engaging with scholarly communications writ large. Some academic libraries have quickly developed infrastructure and support for every activity ranging from data storage and curation to project management and collaboration, while others are just beginning to think about addressing the data needs of their researchers. Regardless of which end of the spectrum they identify with, libraries are still seeking to understand the research landscape and define their role in the process. This article seeks to blend both a general perspective regarding these issues with actual case studies derived from three institutions, University of Cincinnati, Oklahoma State University, and Florida State University, all of which are at different levels of implementation, maturity, and campus involvement.","research process, maturity spectrum, academic librarians, modern research workflows, library services, research data"
"Where and How to Look for Help Matters: Analysis of Support Exchange in Online Health Communities for People Living with HIVResearch is scarce on how direct and indirect support seeking strategies affect support exchange in online health communities. Moreover, prior research has relied mostly on content analysis of forum posts at the post level. In order to generate a more fine-grained analysis of support exchange, we conducted content analysis at the utterance level, taking directness of support seeking, quality of provision, forum type, and seeker gender into account. Our analysis of four popular online support forums for people living with human immunodeficiency virus found that type of support sought and provided, support seeking strategy, and quality of emotional support provision differed in care provider/formal forums versus social/informal forums. Interestingly, indirect support seeking tended to elicit more supportive emotional responses than direct support seeking strategies in all forums; we account for this in terms of type of support sought.

"Defining through expansion: Conducting asynchronous remote communities (arc) research with stigmatized groupsResearchers in HCI have typically relied on face to face (FtF) methods for recruitment and data collection in their research with people living with HIV, whereas social scientists have adopted computer-mediated approaches to address concerns about data validity and access to this stigmatized population. In this paper, we use the asynchronous remote community (ARC) research method to leverage HCI instruments in an online format. ARC successfully engaged people living with HIV in terms of participation and retention by providing a safe space to discuss their experiences. By expanding on past ARC studies, we contribute to an ongoing conversation about defining ARC and working towards increased data validity--especially in stigmatized communities.","data collection, asynchronous remote communities, stigmatized groupsresearchers"

Since that time, studies such as Julia Carlson’s Romantic Marks and Measures (2016) have confirmed the value of attending to what McLane called the “trans-and inter-medial” contexts (243) in which the works of Romantic writers were created, circulated, and consumed. Tom Mole’s new book makes an innovative contribution to this developing body of research. Combining examinations of literary history, print history, and bibliography with considerations of media archaeology and material culture, Mole’s book furthers our understanding of the reception and canonization of five writers now commonly regarded as Romantics: Lord Byron, Felicia Hemans, William Wordsworth, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Sir Walter Scott.As the title of Mole’s book makes clear, he is less interested in the works of these writers per se than in the Victorian contexts in which new ideas about their legacies and their literary period began to cohere.

"Automated Parallel Calculation of Collaborative Statistical Models in RooFitRooFit 4, 6 is the statistical modeling and fitting package used in many big particle physics experiments to extract physical parameters from reduced particle collision data, e.g. the Higgs boson experiments at the LHC 1, 2. RooFit aims to separate particle physics model building and fitting (the users’ goals) from their technical implementation and optimization in the back-end. In this paper, we outline our efforts to further optimize the back-end by automatically running major parts of user models in parallel on multi-core machines. A major challenge is that RooFit allows users to define many different types of models, with different types of computational bottlenecks. Our automatic parallelization framework must then be flexible, while still reducing run-time by at least an order of magnitude, preferably more.

"Beyond ScenographyScenographer and architect Frederick Kiesler’s (1890–1965) manifesto ‘The Theatre is Dead’(1926, see Figure 1) offers a point of departure for this book. The crux of my argument begins from the provocation that, to paraphrase Kiesler, we are working for a scenography that has survived scenography. I trace how in the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries there have been numerous cases for succeeding, transgressing, decentring away from the institutional orthodoxies of theatre. Anticipating the taxonomies of performance as well as the postdramatic, Kiesler’s proposition of a theatre beyond theatre informs my reappraisal of scenography in response to intermedial and immersive practices. It also frames my argument for how scenographic traits operate within diverse material cultures such as installation art or gardening.

We describe how HTRCs implementation of its RDF-compliant workset model helps to satisfy these objectives.","key objectives, scholarly utility, digital library content, digital librariesscholars, workset, extradigital library manipulation, indepth scrutiny"
"Visual Psychophysics for Making Face Recognition Algorithms More ExplainableScientific fields that are interested in faces have developed their own sets of concepts and procedures for understanding how a target model system (be it a person or algorithm) perceives a face under varying conditions. In computer vision, this has largely been in the form of dataset evaluation for recognition tasks where summary statistics are used to measure progress. While aggregate performance has continued to improve, understanding individual causes of failure has been difficult, as it is not always clear why a particular face fails to be recognized, or why an impostor is recognized by an algorithm. Importantly, other fields studying vision have addressed this via the use of visual psychophysics: the controlled manipulation of stimuli and careful study of the responses they evoke in a model system. In this paper, we suggest that visual psychophysics is a viable methodology for making face recognition algorithms more explainable. A comprehensive set of procedures is developed for assessing face recognition algorithm behavior, which is then deployed over state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks and more basic, yet still widely used, shallow and handcrafted feature-based approaches.","recognition tasks, algorithm, dataset evaluation, aggregate performance, visual psychophysics, computer vision, target model system"
"Tensor Field Visualization using Fiber Surfaces of Invariant SpaceScientific visualization developed successful methods for scalar and vector fields. For tensor fields, however, effective, interactive visualizations are still missing despite progress over the last decades. We present a general approach for the generation of separating surfaces in symmetric, second-order, three-dimensional tensor fields. These surfaces are defined as fiber surfaces of the invariant space, i.e. as pre-images of surfaces in the range of a complete set of invariants. This approach leads to a generalization of the fiber surface algorithm by Klacansky et al.  to three dimensions in the range. This is due to the fact that the invariant space is three-dimensional for symmetric second-order tensors over a spatial domain. We present an algorithm for surface construction for simplicial grids in the domain and simplicial surfaces in the invariant space. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to stress fields from …","invariant space, fiber surfaces, secondorder, invariant spacescientific visualization, interactive visualizations, surface, successful methods, general approach"
"Unsupervised Extraction of Epidemic Syndromes from Participatory Influenza Surveillance Self-reported SymptomsSeasonal influenza surveillance is usually carried out by sentinel general practitioners who compile weekly reports based on the number of influenza-like illness (ILI) clinical cases observed among visited patients. This practice for surveillance is generally affected by two main issues: i) reports are usually released with a lag of about one week or more, ii) the definition of a case of influenza-like illness based on patients symptoms varies from one surveillance system to the other, i.e. from one country to the other. The availability of novel data streams for disease surveillance can alleviate these issues; in this paper, we employed data from Influenzanet, a participatory web-based surveillance project which collects symptoms directly from the general population in real time.  We developed an unsupervised probabilistic framework that combines time series analysis of symptoms counts and performs an algorithmic detection of groups of symptoms, hereafter called, syndrome. Symptoms counts were collected through the participatory web-based surveillance platforms of a consortium called Influenzanet which is found to correlate with Influenza-like illness incidence as detected by sentinel doctors. Our aim is to suggest how web-based surveillance data can provide an epidemiological signal capable of detecting influenza-like illness9 temporal trends without relying on a specific case definition. We evaluated the performance of our framework by showing that the temporal trends of the detected syndromes closely follow the ILI incidence as reported by the traditional surveillance, and consist of combinations of symptoms that are compatible with the ILI …","symptoms counts, unsupervised extraction, influenza surveillance, epidemic syndromes"
"If you cant understand it, you cant properly assess it! The reality of assessing security risks in Internet of Things systemsSecurity risk assessment methods have served us well over the last two decades. As the complexity, pervasiveness and automation of technology systems increases, particularly with the Internet of Things (IoT), there is a convincing argument that we will need new approaches to assess risk and build system trust. In this article, we report on a series of scoping workshops and interviews with industry professionals (experts in enterprise systems, IoT and risk) conducted to investigate the validity of this argument. Additionally, our research aims to consult with these professionals to understand two crucial aspects. Firstly, we seek to identify the wider concerns in adopting IoT systems into a corporate environment, be it a smart manufacturing shop floor or a smart office. Secondly, we investigate the key challenges for approaches in industry that attempt to effectively and efficiently assess cyber-risk in the IoT.","smart manufacturing shop floor, security risks, scoping workshops, iot, industry professionals, technology systems increases, convincing argument, things, new approaches"

"Sentiment Polarity Classification at EVALITA: Lessons Learned and Open ChallengesSentiment analysis in social media is a popular task attracting the interest of the research community, also in recent evaluation campaigns of natural language processing tasks in several languages. We report on our experience in the organization of SENTIPOLC (SENTIment POLarity Classification Task), a shared task on sentiment classification of Italian tweets, proposed for the first time in 2014 within the Evalita evaluation campaign. We present the datasets -- which include an enriched annotation scheme for dealing with the impact of figurative language on polarity -- the evaluation methodology, and discuss the approaches and results of participating systems. We also offer a reflection on the open challenges of state-of-the-art systems for sentiment analysis of microblogging in Italian, as they emerge from a qualitative analysis of misclassified tweets.

"Short Review of Sentiment-Based Recommender SystemsSentiment analysis is a trendy domain of Machine Learning which has developed considerably in the last several years. It helps to determine the sentiment of a user in an utterance, a document or a review. Some systems can extract the target of the sentiment, in order to distinguish separated sentiments over the different aspects of the product. Recommender systems (RS) are also more and more used in everyday life due to the rise of the Big Data era. We can count 3 types of Recommender Systems: the ones using Collaborative Filtering, the ones which are Content Based and the hybrid ones which are melting several kinds of information in various proportions. The general recommender systems are using global features, modeling the interest of the user on a specific topic, but they use neither the sentimental information nor the interest and preferences of the user over the different aspects that can be found in the …","recommender systems, recommender systemssentiment, trendy domain, systems"
"Elastic scattering spectroscopy for early detection of breast cancer: partially supervised Bayesian image classification of scanned sentinel lymph nodesSentinel lymph node biopsy is a standard diagnosis procedure to determine whether breast cancer has spread to the lymph glands in the armpit (the axillary nodes). The metastatic status of the sentinel node (the first node in the axillary chain that drains the affected breast) is the determining factor in surgery between conservative lumpectomy and more radical mastectomy including axillary node excision. The traditional assessment of the node requires sample preparation and pathologist interpretation. An automated elastic scattering spectroscopy (ESS) scanning device was constructed to take measurements from the entire cut surface of the excised sentinel node and to produce ESS images for cancer diagnosis. Here, we report on a partially supervised image classification scheme employing a Bayesian multivariate, finite mixture model with a Markov random field (MRF) spatial prior.

"Learning to combine multiple string similarity metrics for effective toponym matchingSeveral tasks related to geographical information retrieval and to the geographical information sciences involve toponym matching, that is, the problem of matching place names that share a common referent. In this article, we present the results of a wide-ranging evaluation on the performance of different string similarity metrics over the toponym matching task. We also report on experiments involving the usage of supervised machine learning for combining multiple similarity metrics, which has the natural advantage of avoiding the manual tuning of similarity thresholds. Experiments with a very large dataset show that the performance differences for the individual similarity metrics are relatively small, and that carefully tuning the similarity threshold is important for achieving good results. The methods based on supervised machine learning, particularly when considering ensembles of decision trees, can achieve good …","performance, geographical information sciences, common referent, toponym matching, supervised machine, geographical information retrieval, string similarity, effective toponym matchingseveral tasks, similarity thresholds, multiple similarity metrics"
"Malcontented Agents: From the novellas to Much Ado about Nothing and The Duchess of MalfiShakespeareVs Much Ado about Nothing (c. 1598) and WebsterVs The Duchess of Malfi (c. 1613) are two plays in which Matteo Bandello’s portrayal of evil agents in his novellas exert a constant, even if not immediately obvious, influence. Remote from each other chronologically and generically, Shakespeare’s comedy and Webster’s tragedy make common use of a distinctive character type, which has an equivalent in the Bandello source: the melancholy, embittered, and vindictive outsider known at the time, as well as by modern critics, as the malcontent (Nigri, The Origin of Malcontent). Comparing how and to what purpose each dramatist duplicated, altered, or expanded the figures he found in the source story provides an insight into his way of working and informs our understanding of the plays.","bandello source, malcontented agents, novellas"
"Assembling the body/text: Frankenstein in new mediaShelley concocted on a dark night in Switzerland in 1816 has maintained a narrative urgency through the intervening centuries, its afterlife sustained through adaptation and transformation via the dominant and/or cutting-edge technologies of each era. This long history of adaptation has continued into new media platforms, creating opportunities to consider how the themes of the novel interact with notions of hybrid textuality, new media identities, and the boundaries of the human offered by an engagement with digital frameworks for storytelling. This is in addition to the great extent to which the themes pursued in the text resonate with contemporary concerns around biotechnology, genetic modification, and the threat of a posthuman future.

"Using FRAM to evaluate ship designs and regulationsShip design decisions and regulations are made with the intentions of improving ship performance and safety. While design decisions and regulations may have strong theoretical merits, there can be uncertainty regarding if the intended improvements are experienced in practice. The approach put forth in this paper demonstrates how it can be checked and understood if these design decisions and regulations are having the intended impact on ship operations. The performance of a shipping operation can be tracked using system performance measurement techniques, which help understand if improved performance is being achieved. Then, by using the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) to monitor the functional dynamics of each performance measurement, an understanding the processes that produce that measurement can be obtained.

"The dramaturgy of theatre fieldtrips: studying cultural relativism in situShort fieldtrips offer unique opportunities to teach cultural relativism in context. Through travel, theatrical practices can be experienced as nodes in complex social webs, where the material aspects of performance are inseparable from the people who make, sponsor and attend performances. The author reflects on his experiences organising theatre fieldtrips to Indonesia over a six-year period (2013–2018) to think about the implications of travel more generally for the pedagogy of theatre, using concepts from geography, anthropology and theatre studies. Thinking of field trips as dramaturgical processes provides a framework to better devise, conduct and evaluate such trips.","theatrical practices, dramaturgy, theatre fieldtrips, cultural relativism, complex social webs"
"Variable article use with acronyms and initialismsShortening is a common type of word-formation in many languages.  Crystal (2008)  distinguishes two kinds of abbreviation: initialisms and acronyms. Article use in English is variable with both acronyms and initialisms used as proper names (e.g. (the) UKIP, at the UN vs. at MIT). The question is whether variability is largely dependent on the semantics of the underlying full form (i.e. whether this is derived from a proper name or common noun) or whether the two types of abbreviation show different behaviour with respect to variable article use. This paper uses data from CoStEP, a new, word-aligned version of EuroParl, and a data-driven approach to investigate variable article use with abbreviations and their full forms uttered by English native speakers and compares the findings to data from parallel German and Italian corpora.

"Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Using Deep LearningSince about a decade ago, deep learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning technique and produced state-of-the-art results in many application domains, ranging from computer vision and speech recognition to NLP. Applying deep learning to sentiment analysis has also become very popular recently. In this paper, we propose a comparative study for multimodal sentiment analysis using deep neural networks involving visual recognition and natural language processing. Initially we make different models for the model using text and another for image and see the results on various models and compare them.","sentiment analysis, deep learning, speech recognition, computer vision, multimodal sentiment analysis, visual recognition, natural language processing, deep neural networks"
"Match-Funding as a Formula for Crowdfunding: A Case Study on the Goteo. org PlatformSince crowdfunding first appeared, and with the proliferation of platforms in recent years, various systems and formulas of operation have appeared within the general crowdfunding model. One such system, still in its early days, is match-funding (co-funding between citizens and institutions), which permits public and private organizations to double financial contributions for projects from individual users. This paper focuses on the Goteo. org platform, a pioneer in the international development of this model. The advantages and impact of this method of crowdfunding compared to the traditional method is analyzed using data collected on the behavior in 14 match-funding calls for projects on Goteo. org in the last 5 years.

"ON SONORITY AND ACCENT INTOCHARIAN B1 HANNES A. FELLNERSince early 2011 the Linguistics Department at the University of Vienna has hosted a project to create an electronic edition of all available Tocharian manuscript fragments combined with a linguistic database (A Comprehensive Edition of Tocharian Manuscripts CEToM: www. univie. ac. at/tocharian). The present study demonstrates how the CEToM database can effectively be employed in the study of Tocharian B phonology, specifically its accentual system. Jasanoff (2015) argued that the location of the stress accent is the result of sonority-based principles. The eventual goal of our ongoing study is to test the predictions of Jasanoff’s proposal on the entire Tocharian B nominal system. To that end we present an early version of an algorithm implemented in Perl that automatically determines the underlying accent of nominal stems.","tocharian manuscripts, database, sonority, comprehensive edition, electronic edition, linguistics department"
"Writing Centers and Academic Professionalization in the Russian FederationSince the founding of the first Russian writing centers in 2011, the model has spread throughout the country. There are now fifteen writing centers in the Russian Federation, though the vast majority of them serve faculty rather than students. This paper argues that while the American writing center model has served as the inspiration for these programs, the unique development of Russian centers is being driven by the traditional relationship of the academy to the state, which is seeking to elevate the international prestige of native universities by encouraging Russian faculty to publish in international venues, which usually means in English. However, like their US counterparts, Russian writing center workers are seeking to establish a professional identity that transcends these utilitarian demands.","russian writing, academic professionalization, international prestige, model, writing centers"
"Depoliticization, resilience and the Herceptin post-code lottery crisis: holding back the tideSince the latest financial crisis in 2008, we have witnessed the rise in popularity of Karl Polanyi’s work. At the inception of the crisis, it was possible to detect a growing scientific interest in the double movement thesis in particular (Dale ). This was accompanied by the widespread – if short-lived – expectation of the demise of the neoliberal consensus and the arrival of another great transformation. Many assumed this great transformation would take the form of a second coming: the restoration of the post-war welfare state, including its Keynesian utilities and maintenance systems. Mainstream readings of the crisis presented it as an empirical refutation of neoliberal arguments for market solutions and a vindication of Keynesian stabilization policies (Akerlof and Shiller 2010; Skidelsky ; Taylor ).

"Motion cues tune social influence in shoaling fishSocial interactions have important consequences for individual fitness. Collective actions, however, are notoriously context-dependent and identifying how animals rapidly weigh the actions of others despite environmental uncertainty remains a fundamental challenge in biology. By exposing zebrafish (Danio rerio) to virtual fish silhouettes in a maze we isolated how the relative strength of a visual feature guides individual directional decisions and, subsequently, tunes social influence. We varied the relative speed and coherency with which a portion of silhouettes adopted a direction (leader/distractor ratio) and established that solitary zebrafish display a robust optomotor response to follow leader silhouettes that moved much faster than their distractors, regardless of stimulus coherency. Although recruitment time decreased as a power law of zebrafish group size, individual decision times retained a speed-accuracy …","virtual fish silhouettes, individual fitness, collective actions, zebrafish, important consequences, fishsocial interactions"
"On the use of URLs and hashtags in age prediction of Twitter usersSocial media data represent an important resource for behavioral analysis of the ageing population. This paper addresses the problem of age prediction from Twitter dataset, where the prediction issue is viewed as a classification task. For this purpose, an innovative model based on Convolutional Neural Network is devised. To this end, we rely on language-related features and social media specific metadata. More specifically, we introduce two features that have not been previously considered in the literature: the content of URLs and hashtags appearing in tweets. We also employ distributed representations of words and phrases present in tweets, hashtags and URLs, pre-trained on appropriate corpora in order to exploit their semantic information in age prediction. We show that our CNN-based classifier, when compared with an SVM baseline model, yields an improvement of 12.3% and 6.6% in the micro …","age prediction, convolutional neural network, twitter, features, important resource, behavioral analysis"
"The BigFoot Initiative: An Investigation of Digital Footprint Awareness in Social MediaSocial media has become an important part of modern-day communication. Advantages span from instant communication via direct messages to sharing and consuming content and experiences. Lately, social media applications have been criticized for assisting the spreading of harmful or fake news and distorting reality by enabling unauthentic self-representation. It is often argued, that social media platforms are solely responsible for these challenges and for offering solutions. This research uses the notion of a digital footprint, a codified representation of a users social media engagement, to facilitate user reflection. This footprint, however, is mostly a product of the users deliberate and conscious engagement. This paper argues that users also have a responsibility in addressing the above-mentioned challenges by increasing their awareness of their social media usage.

"Evaluation of Biases in Self-reported Demographic and Psychometric Information: Traditional versus Facebook-based SurveysSocial media in scientific research offer a unique digital observatory of human behaviours and hence great opportunities to conduct research at large scale answering complex sociodemographic questions. We focus on the identification and assessment of biases in social media administered surveys. This study aims to shed light on population, self-selection and behavioural biases, empirically comparing the consistency between self-reported information collected traditionally versus social media administered questionnaires, including demographic and psychometric attributes. We engaged a demographically representative cohort of young adults in Italy (approximately 4,000 participants) in taking a traditionally administered online survey and then, after one year, we invited them to use our ad hoc Facebook application (988 accepted) where they filled in part of the initial survey. We assess the statistically significant differences indicating population, self-selection, and behavioural biases due to the different context in which the questionnaire is administered. Our findings suggest that surveys administered on Facebook do not exhibit major biases with respect to traditionally administered surveys neither in terms of demographics, nor personality traits. Loyalty, authority, and social binding values were higher in the Facebook platform, probably due to the platforms intrinsic social character. We conclude, that Facebook apps are valid research tools for administering demographic and psychometric surveys provided that the entailed biases are taken into consideration. We contribute to the characterisation of Facebook apps as a valid scientific tool to …","facebook, scientific research, unique digital observatory, evaluation, social media, human behaviours, psychometric information"
"A Large-Scale Social Media Corpus for the Detection of Youth Depression (Project Note)Social media is frequently used by youth to share their health and mental issues. Therefore, social media has become a major online resource to study the language used to express issues such as depression and self-harm which can help to identify individuals at risk of harm. Furthermore, depression and suicide are generally closely related especially that depression is the most common symptom associated with self-harm acts such as suicide. In this project, we propose to build a linguistically annotated corpus with the sentiment analysis in order to study the youth behavior through their social media discourse across the MENA region. We plan to create a large-scale dataset of users with self-reported depression messages. Several correlational analyses will be performed to understand the psycho-social-behaviors.

"Locations & Languages: Towards Multilingual User Movement Analysis in Social MediaSocial microblogging platforms such as Twitter have been used by many users to express their sentiments and opinions resulting in exponentially growing amounts of heterogeneous data. This opens new research proposals to map with such data many natural phenomena. In this paper, we visualize various patterns related to multilingualism on social microblogging platforms. In particular, we analyze characteristics of Twitter users based on their choice of languages and the change in locations from which they tweet. The analysis we undertake assumes language and location of tweets as key factors. The results show that locations and languages are correlated with mobility patterns of multilingual Twitter users.","heterogeneous data, multilingual user movement analysis, patterns, locations, social mediasocial"
"Navigating Unmountable Media with the Digital Forensics XML File SystemSome computer storage is non-navigable by current general-purpose computers. This could be because of obsolete interface software, or a more specialized storage system lacking widespread support. These storage systems may contain artifacts of great cultural, historical, or technical significance, but implementing compatible interfaces may be beyond available resources. We developed the DFXML File System (DFXMLFS) to enable navigation of arbitrary storage systems that fulfill a minimum feature set of the POSIX file system standard. Our approach advocates for a two-step workflow that separates parsing the storages file system structures from navigating the storage like a contemporary file system, including file contents. The parse extracts essential file system metadata, serializing to Digital Forensics XML for later consumption as a read-only file system.","specialized storage system, forensics xml, file system, storage systems, file"
"The spatial history of state power: A view from imperial ChinaSpatial history, a field that is still coming into clear focus, combines the geographer’s focus on landscape variation with the historian’s analysis of past social structures and their transformation. Yet early on, Richard White noted the challenge of representing movement and change over time and through space simultaneously. As he points out, GIS ‘often ends up emphasizing not the constructed-ness of space, but rather its given-ness’. 1 Nevertheless, White simply proposes more compelling visualization. He does not introduce a theoretical or analytical agenda that would allow the field to integrate complex spatial and temporal processes in a single interpretive model, nor does he suggest a methodological alternative to GIS.","landscape variation, chinaspatial history, spatial history, state power, focus, clear focus, richard white"
"Integrated Visualization of Space and Time: A Distributed Cognition PerspectiveSpatiotemporal visualizations pose certain challenges for comprehension and reasoning processes. This specifically applies to casual users who want to gain an overview of the spatiotemporal origins of large cultural collections in a relatively short time. Based on a distributed cognition approach, we compare four visualization techniques (coordinated multiple views, color coding, animation and space-time cube representations), which offer different solutions to represent spatial and temporal information in an integrated fashion. We firstly assess the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques with regard to existing work. We then complement these findings with a close look at the reasoning processes of 18 casual users. In a mixed methods study, they explored a photo collection from the middle of the 20th century by means of all four spatiotemporal visualization techniques. We investigate and compare the effects of these techniques on processes of internalization, spatiotemporal reasoning and comprehension by analyzing the observed spatial, temporal and spatiotemporal insights and the degree of connectedness of these insights. Our results provide an in-depth look at how each visualization technique supports the construction of coherent internal representations and, together with data on cognitive load and subjective references, help to understand for which tasks and users they are suited.","reasoning processes, casual users, cognition approach, spatiotemporal origins, distributed cognition perspectivespatiotemporal visualizations, techniques, integrated visualization, visualization techniques"
"Translating Critical Design: Agonism in Engineering EducationSpeculative and Critical Design (SCD) methods can produce provocative artifacts that help audiences recognize the political worlds in which all designed objects participate. Similarly, SCD can be leveraged in educational settings to help design students engage with social and political theory through their design work. SCD practices, however, are rarely seen outside of arts and creative design spaces, which limits any potential political impact they may have. This article traces the integration of SCD practices into “the hard case” of engineering education—a space with radically different, and at times oppositional, intellectual, and political traditions than creative design. I argue that the SCD platforms must reflexively account for and bridge radical epistemological differences among design disciplines, including those disciplines that may have an innate aversion to “political” content, if they are to have transformational …","educational settings, engineering educationspeculative, political theory, creative design spaces, agonism, scd practices, political worlds, critical design"
"Feasibility study on mouse live imaging after spinal cord injury and poly (lactide-co-glycolide) bridge implantationSpinal cord injury (SCI) causes permanent paralysis below the damaged area. SCI is linked to neuronal death, demyelination, and limited ability of neuronal fibers to regenerate. Regeneration capacity is limited by the presence of many inhibitory factors in the spinal cord environment. The use of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) bridges has demonstrated the ability to sustain long-term regeneration after SCI in a cervical hemisection mouse model. Critically, imaging of regenerating fibers and the myelination status of these neuronal filaments is a severe limitation to progress in SCI research. We used a transgenic mouse model that selectively expresses fluorescent reporters (eGFP) in the neuronal fibers of the spinal cord. We implanted a PLG bridge at C5 vertebra after hemisection and evaluated in live animals’ neuronal fibers at the bridge interface and within the bridge 8 weeks postimplant.

Unpacking this concept within the hybrid literary form, she argues that the rise of the verse-novel is in part a response to conversations about modernizing the epic during the age of the novel.

"Once upon a Spacetime: Visual Storytelling in Cognitive and Geotemporal Information SpacesStories are an essential mode, not only of human communication—but also of thinking. This paper reflects on the internalization of stories from a cognitive perspective and outlines a visualization framework for supporting the analysis of narrative geotemporal data. We discuss the strengths and limitations of standard techniques for representing spatiotemporal data (coordinated views, animation or slideshow, layer superimposition, juxtaposition, and space-time cube representation) and think about their effects on mental representations of a story. Many current visualization systems offer multiple views and allow the user to investigate different aspects of a story. From a cognitive point of view, it is important to assist users in reconnecting these multiple perspectives into a coherent picture—eg, by utilizing coherence techniques like seamless transitions. A case study involving visualizing biographical narratives illustrates how the design of advanced visualization systems can be cognitively and conceptually grounded to support the construction of an integrated internal representation.

"Stress and burnout in anesthesia residency: an exploratory case study of peer support groupsStress and burnout are alarmingly prevalent in anesthesiologists, with the highest risk occurring during anesthesia residency training. To better understand this phenomenon, we conducted a mixed methods case study of our anesthesia training program to explore the residents’ accounts of stress and burnout and the potential value of peer support groups. Eight out of thirty eight residents participated in nine monthly peer support group (PSG) meetings followed by a focus group interview about stress and burnout in training and the value of PSG. We compared the participants’ mean pre-and post-PSG Maslach Burnout Inventory®(MBI) and Perceived Stress Scale®(PSS) and analysed the focus group interview for recurring themes. We captured the perspectives of twenty seven out of thirty residents who did not participate in support groups (non-participants) through an online survey on stress and burnout. We found evidence of a high prevalence of stress and burnout from the MBI and PSS scores and survey responses. Analysis of the focus group interview showed that the specific stressors of anesthesia training included: an individually-based model of training that predisposes to isolation from peers, an over-reliance on the quality of the faculty-resident relationship and the critical, high stakes nature of the profession. Residents strongly endorsed the value of PSG in decreasing isolation, enhancing validation, and support through the sharing of experiences. Lack of dedicated time and integration into the training program were major barriers to PSG participation. These barriers need to be overcome in order to fully realize its role in mitigating stress …","anesthesia residency, highest risk, anesthesia residency training, burnout, anesthesia training, peer support, focus group interview, stress"
"How can rhythmic haptic cueing using wearable haptic devices help gait rehabilitation for stroke survivors: a longitudinal pilot studyStroke is one of the leading causes for long-term adult disabilities. More than half of all stroke survivors depend on others for everyday activities after they are discharged from hospital. One of the conditions a stroke survivor may experience is hemiparetic gait. Typical characteristics of hemiparetic gait are: reduced speed, increased step variability, spatial and temporal asymmetry. These, in turn, lead to joint pain, bone degeneration, higher risk of falls, and fracture. To improve health and daily activities, rehabilitation, and physiotherapy is an integral part of the recovery plan. Rehabilitation is commonly performed in a clinical setting however this kind of long-term care is expensive. Therefore, reliable in-house rehabilitation techniques are highly desirable. In addition, there is evidence in the literature to suggest home-based rehabilitation is often more beneficial to the patients.  Numerous studies have shown rhythmic cueing as a promising technique for post-stroke gait rehabilitation. Auditory rhythmic cueing has shown improvement in gait patterns. Specifically, auditory cueing can assist with improvements in temporal and spatial symmetry, along with increases in walking speed, step and stride length. However, auditory cueing may be obstructive in an outdoor setting while trying to listen for alerts or having a conversation with others.  In such settings, haptic (touch based) cueing can be highly effective as means of covert, unobstructive rhythmic cueing. Recent studies have shown promising results for rhythmic haptic cueing using wearable haptic devices for post-stroke gait rehabilitation with improvement in temporal symmetry, increase in stride …","rhythmic haptic cueing, stroke survivors, gait rehabilitation, hemiparetic gait, haptic cueing, longitudinal pilot studystroke, rhythmic cueing, longterm adult disabilities"
"Expectations for tonal cadences: Sensory and cognitive priming effectsStudies examining the formation of melodic and harmonic expectations during music listening have repeatedly demonstrated that a tonal context primes listeners to expect certain (tonally related) continuations over others. However, few such studies have (1) selected stimuli using ready examples of expectancy violation derived from real-world instances of tonal music, (2) provided a consistent account for the influence of sensory and cognitive mechanisms on tonal expectancies by comparing different computational simulations, or (3) combined melodic and harmonic representations in modelling cognitive processes of expectation. To resolve these issues, this study measures expectations for the most recurrent cadence patterns associated with tonal music and then simulates the reported findings using three sensory–cognitive models of auditory expectation.

"Learning-Free Iris Segmentation Revisited: A First Step Toward Fast Volumetric Operation Over Video SamplesSubject matching performance in iris biometrics is contingent upon fast, high-quality iris segmentation. In many cases, iris biometrics acquisition equipment takes a number of images in sequence and combines the segmentation and matching results for each image to strengthen the result. To date, segmentation has occurred in 2D, operating on each image individually. But such methodologies, while powerful, do not take advantage of potential gains in performance afforded by treating sequential images as volumetric data. As a first step in this direction, we apply the Flexible Learning-Free Reconstructoin of Neural Volumes (FLoRIN) framework, an open source segmentation and reconstruction framework originally designed for neural microscopy volumes, to volumetric segmentation of iris videos. Further, we introduce a novel dataset of near-infrared iris videos, in which each subjects pupil rapidly changes size due to visible-light stimuli, as a test bed for FLoRIN. We compare the matching performance for iris masks generated by FLoRIN, deep-learning-based (SegNet), and Daugmans (OSIRIS) iris segmentation approaches. We show that by incorporating volumetric information, FLoRIN achieves a factor of 3.6 to an order of magnitude increase in throughput with only a minor drop in subject matching performance. We also demonstrate that FLoRIN-based iris segmentation maintains this speedup on low-resource hardware, making it suitable for embedded biometrics systems.","segmentation, flexible learningfree reconstructoin, iris biometrics, fast volumetric operation, iris segmentation, video samplessubject matching performance, volumetric data"

Based entirely on sparse operations, it provides highly efficient methods for compiling document-feature matrices and for manipulating these or using them in further quantitative analysis. Using C++ and multithreading extensively, quanteda is also considerably faster and more efficient than other R and Python packages in processing large textual data.The package is designed for R users needing to apply natural language processing to texts, from documents to final analysis. Its capabilities match or exceed those provided in many end-user software applications, many of which are expensive and not open source. The package is therefore of great benefit to researchers, students, and other analysts with fewer financial resources. While using quanteda requires R programming knowledge, its API is designed to enable powerful, efficient analysis with a minimum of steps. By emphasizing consistent design, furthermore, quanteda lowers the barriers to learning and using NLP and quantitative text analysis even for proficient R programmers.","textual datasummary, language processing, comprehensive workflow, quantitative analysis, package, processing"
"Printed Plays and Polyglot Books: The Multilingual Textures of Early Modern English DramaT he purpose of this essayis to demonstrate some ways in which the physical qualities of multilingual dictionaries and language manuals were in conversation with works of printed drama in early modern England. Attention to these cross-generic characteristics, I argue, helps us to see England’s plays in a new and more cosmopolitan light—not solely according to nationally focused studies such as Richard Helgerson’s influential Forms of Nationhood (1992) or conditioned by the necessary geographical and linguistic limits of theShort-Title Catalogue. 1 Indeed, attending to the categorical in-betweenness of multilingual and transnational publications enables us to see early modern English plays as texts","physical qualities, modern english, language manuals, multilingual dictionaries, polyglot books, multilingual textures, printed plays"

"Ranking Without Learning: Towards Historical Relevance-based Ranking of Social Images.Tag-based Social Image Retrieval (TagIR) aims to find relevant social images using keyword queries. State-of-the-art TagIR techniques typically rank query results based on relevance, temporal or popularity criteria. However, these criteria may not always be sufficient to match diverse search intents of users. In this paper, we present a novel ranking scheme that ranks query results (images) based on their historical relevance. Informally, an image is historically relevant if its visual content is relevant to the query and it depicts objects, scenes, or events that are related to human history. To this end, we propose a learning-agnostic technique that leverages Wikipedia to quantify historical relevance of images. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our ranking scheme using Flickr dataset.","relevant social images, relevance, social image retrieval, keyword queries, tagir techniques, social images, image"

"Linking learning behavior analytics and learning science concepts: designing a learning analytics dashboard for feedback to support learning regulationTechnological advancements have generated a strong interest in exploring learner behavior data through learning analytics to provide both learner and instructor with process-oriented feedback in the form of dashboards. However, little is known about the typology of dashboard feedback relevant for different learning goals, learners and teachers. While most dashboards and the feedback that they give are based only on learner performance indicators, research shows that effective feedback needs also to be grounded in the regulatory mechanisms underlying learning processes and an awareness of the learners learning goals. The design artefact presented in this article uses a conceptual model that visualizes the relationships between dashboard design and the learning sciences to provide cognitive and behavioral process-oriented feedback to learners and teachers to support regulation of learning.

"Data Mining Research with In-copyright and Use-limited Text Datasets: Preliminary Findings from a Systematic Literature Review and Stakeholder InterviewsText data mining and analysis has emerged as a viable research method for scholars, following the growth of mass digitization, digital publishing, and scholarly interest in data re-use.  Yet the texts that comprise datasets for analysis are frequently protected by copyright or other intellectual property rights that limit their access and use. This paper discusses the role of libraries at the intersection of data mining and intellectual property, asserting that academic libraries are vital partners in enabling scholars to effectively incorporate text data mining into their research. We report on activities leading up to an IMLS-funded National Forum of stakeholders and discuss preliminary findings from a systematic literature review, as well as initial results of interviews with forum stakeholders.  Emerging themes suggest the need for a multi-pronged distributed approach that includes a public campaign for building awareness and advocacy, development of best practice guides for library support services and training, and international efforts toward data standardization and copyright harmonization.","viable research method, intellectual property, imlsfunded national forum, stakeholder interviewstext data mining, literature, data mining research, mass digitization, scholarly interest, uselimited text datasets, digital publishing, preliminary findings"

"Arctic change and possible influence on mid-latitude climate and weather: a US CLIVAR White PaperThe Arctic has warmed more than twice as fast as the global average since the mid 20th century, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification (AA). These profound changes to the Arctic system have coincided with a period of ostensibly more frequent events of extreme weather across the Northern Hemisphere (NH) mid-latitudes, including extreme heat and rainfall events and recent severe winters. Though winter temperatures have generally warmed since 1960 over mid-to-high latitudes, the acceleration in the rate of warming at high-latitudes, relative to the rest of the NH, started approximately in 1990. Trends since 1990 show cooling over the NH continents, especially in Northern Eurasia. The possible link between Arctic change and mid-latitude climate and weather has spurred a rush of new observational and modeling studies. A number of workshops held during 2013-2014 have helped frame the problem and have called for continuing and enhancing efforts for improving our understanding of Arctic-mid-latitude linkages and its attribution to the occurrence of extreme climate and weather events. Although these workshops have outlined some of the major challenges and provided broad recommendations, further efforts are needed to synthesize the diversified research results to identify where community consensus and gaps exist. Building upon findings and recommendations of the previous workshops, the US CLIVAR Working Group on Arctic Change and Possible Influence on Mid-latitude Climate and Weather convened an international workshop at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, on February 1-3, 2017.

"Hugo Grotius and the Century of Revolution, 1613-1718: Transnational Reception in English Political ThoughtThe Dutch thinker Hugo Grotius (1583–1645) was a towering figure in seventeenth-century intellectual life, as anyone whose work touches at all on seventeenth-century law, theology, humanism, political thought, or neo-Latin poetry is surely aware. According to the seventeenth-century English divine John Owen, Hugo Grotius was a “a Gyant in all kinds of Literature”. In England alone, Grotius was seen variously as a republican, a resistance theorist, an absolutist, a Socinian, an Arminian, a crypto-Catholic, a de facto High-Church Anglican, an apologist for the VOC, a learned poet, an irenicist, an Erastian, and many other things besides. But because Grotius’ works spanned so many topics and genres–and had wide ramifications across time and space–detailed studies of his reception have faced major hurdles.

In their AllAmsterdam Acts project2, the SAA digitizes/indexes all its notarial acts. For Golden Agents,studying the interactions between the production and consumption of the creative industriesof the Dutch Golden Age is relevant because the probate inventories, testaments, etc. in theseacts reveal the objects that families living in Amsterdam had in their houses. However, to linkthese data to other relevant collections we need to disambiguate names to identify individuals.This is a challenging task because (i) citizens in the Dutch Golden Age were not given anyidentification number; (ii) the information supplied in a single index do not suffice to uniquelyidentify an individual (weak identity criteria) and (iii) because of multiple occurrences of a sin-gle individual within an index.

"An Enhanced LSB-Image Steganography Using the Hybrid Canny-Sobel Edge Detection DOI: https://doi.org/10.2478/cait-2018-0029The Internet is a public network with many issues of data transfer security. Steganography is a data transmission security technique that is done by hiding the message in a container media, such as an image. The media certainly has its limited payload to accommodate the embedded data. This paper proposes a method for increasing the payload of secret messages in an image. The edge area is used to accommodate more message bits because the image edge area can better tolerate pixel value changes. In this research paper, Canny and Sobel detectors are combined to get a wider edge area. This two-detector combined method provides a larger edge area for greater payload of messages while maintaining imperceptibility of stego-images.","payload, steganography, public network, message, enhanced lsbimage steganography, data transfer security, container media, edge"

Most extensively studied are SUN1 and SUN2 proteins, which are widely expressed in mammals. Although SUN1 and SUN2 play functionally redundant roles in several cellular processes, more recent studies have revealed diverse and distinct functions for SUN1. While several recent in vitro structural studies have revealed the molecular details of various fragments of SUN2, no such structural information is available for SUN1. Herein, we conduct a systematic analysis of the molecular relationships between SUN1 and SUN2, highlighting key similarities and differences that could lead to clues into their distinct functions.

"Something will be connected-Semantic mapping from CMDI to Parthenos EntitiesThe Parthenos project aims at pooling resources from existing infrastructures of the broad cultural heritage and humanities cluster. Central to this effort is the common semantic framework-Parthenos Entities-that shall serve as a target data model for mapping of metadata about resources from participating infrastructures. Acting as a representative of the linguistic domain, CLARIN will deliver metadata about language resources. Within the Parthenos project, separate provisions are foreseen for the mapping task. However, given the complexity of CLARIN’s underlying metadata model (CMDI), traditional one-to-one schema mapping is not applicable and an alternative conceptual and technical approach is required. This paper presents the current mapping solution and points out a number of issues identified during the process partly perpetuated from the ongoing metadata quality discussion within CLARIN.","metadata, connectedsemantic mapping, common semantic frameworkparthenos, parthenos entitiesthe parthenos project, resources"
""" Shakespeare Theatre Companys Macbeth and the Limits of Multiculturalism."" Early Modern Culture 13 (2018): 240-246The STC Macbeth’s setting and predominantly multiethnic cast brought to mind Orson Welles’s landmark 1936 Macbeth which was set in Haiti and featured an all-black cast. In both cases, the ethnicity and race of the cast matched that of the characters and cultures in the adaptation’s respective universe. Tommy’s production engaged in two models of nontraditional casting, namely conceptual casting, a model “in which actors of color are self-consciously cast in roles to enhance the play’s social resonance,” and cross-cultural casting, an approach that translates the universe of the play to a different culture and location. In some instances, multicultural theater, whether made locally or imported as touring theater, can receive mixed reception due to audience’s investment in some form of cultural authenticity. Iqbal Khan’s Much Ado About Nothing (RSC, Stratford-upon-Avon, August, 2012), for example, was set in contemporary Delhi and performed by a cast of second-generation Indian British actors. The production appropriated Bollywood-inspired music.","early modern culture, orson welles, theater, respective universe, stc macbeth, shakespeare theatre company, multiethnic cast"
"“The dread of something after death”: Hamlet and the Emotional Afterlife of Shakespearean RevenantsThe Shakespearean corpus provides fifty instances of the word “dread.” My examination suggests that an atmosphere of dread correlates with specific genres (the Roman plays, English histories), subjects (politics and history), and works (The Rape of Lucrece and Hamlet). In a few cases, notably Lucrece, “dread” is also associated with an acute awareness of life-after-death in the form of history and reputation. Dread of God’s judgment is a common theme in uses of word before 1600, as recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary. In Hamlet, however, there emerges a more modern connotation of “dread” as a malaise that persists after death. The old-fashioned ghost has confidence that his material condition in whatever afterlife he inhabits could make Hamlet’s hair stand on end; he has a traditional early modern sense of dread as terror that expresses itself through the body. But the dread that stays Hamlet’s hand is different. I place Hamlet and his father’s ghost within the context of other early modern revenants who relive emotionally their pasts. These revenants belong to the poetic female complaint, a tradition popular in the 1590s that specifically informs The Rape of Lucrece. The dread felt by Lucrece and Hamlet comes from anticipating historical reputation but also from a perception of the conflict between historical character and lived reality that haunts historical actors in the afterlife.","english histories, roman plays, emotional afterlife, specific genres, dread, shakespearean, early modern"
"Investigating the Relationships between Scholars and Politicians in Ancient China: Taking the Yuanyou Era as an ExampleThe Song Dynasty was a decisive period of transformation in ancient China, during which relationships between scholars and politicians are thought to have become closer and closer, and this change is considered part of the “Tang–Song transition.” In the Song Dynasty, the Yuanyou 元祐 era (1086–94) was a critical and complex period with regard to its political environment. The major purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationships between scholars and politicians during this period. The connections between figures collected from the CBDB (China Biographical Database) include both literary relations and political relations. Two scholars have a literary relation when both of them write to a common third figure, and a political relation between two politicians is demonstrated through such connections as political support associations, recommendation sponsorship, and oppositional political affiliations. In the present study, two matrices are respectively constructed according to literary and political relations among figures and a Poisson-Gamma factorization model is adopted to obtain the key factors of the matrices. According to calculated results and literary history, the scholars can be clearly classified into three groups. We identified two groups of the politicians with this method, while we found other politicians to have steered a course between them. Furthermore, the figures engaged in common literary pursuits are more likely to share common political goals. As a result, the observation that scholars and politicians are related closely in the Yuanyou era confirms that this period must have featured literati politics.","political relations, politicians, examplethe song dynasty, china biographical database, ancient china, yuanyou era, relationships, scholars"

"New theories for new instruments: Fabrizio Mordentes proportional compass and the genesis of Giordano Brunos atomist geometryThe aim of this article is to shed light on an understudied aspect of Giordano Brunos intellectual biography, namely, his career as a mathematical practitioner. Early interpreters, especially, have criticized Brunos mathematics for being “outdated” or too “concrete”. However, thanks to developments in the study of early modern mathematics and the rediscovery of Brunos first mathematical writings (four dialogues on Fabrizios Mordente proportional compass), we are in a position to better understand Brunos mathematics. In particular, this article aims to reopen the question of whether Bruno anticipated the concept of infinitesimal quantity. It does so by providing an analysis of the dialogues on Mordentes compass and of the historical circumstances under which those dialogues were written.","new theories, fabrizio mordente, giordano bruno, new instruments, proportional compass"
"Belly-Rippers, Surgical Innovation and the Ovariotomy ControversyThe aim of this series is to illuminate the development and impact of medicine and the biomedical sciences in the modern era. The series was founded by the late Professor John Pickstone, and its ambitions reflect his commitment to the integrated study of medicine, science and technology in their contexts. He repeatedly commented that it was a pity that the foundation discipline of the field, for which he popularized the acronym ‘HSTM’(History of Science, Technology and Medicine) had been the history of science rather than the history of medicine. His point was that historians of science had too often focused just on scientific ideas and institutions, while historians of medicine always had to consider the understanding, management and meanings of diseases in their socio-economic, cultural, technological and political contexts. In the event, most of the books in the series dealt with medicine and the biomedical …","biomedical sciences, contexts, bellyrippers, late professor john pickstone, modern era, surgical innovation"
Identifying social learning between Roman amphorae workshops through morphometric similarityThe aim of this study is to identify dynamics of social learning between amphorae workshops during the the Roman Empire. The Baetica province developed a massive infrastructure of olive oil production that supplied the Western provinces of Rome for almost 300 years. The olive oil produced in this area was shipped through maritime and riverine transport networks in a standardized amphoric shape made in several workshops spread around the region. These workshops have generated a large amount of evidence but it is still difficult to understand through archaeological proxies how the production of amphorae was organized.,"baetica province, amphorae workshops, riverine transport networks, olive oil, production, social learning, roman empire, massive infrastructure"
"Developing an integrated approach to the assessment of competence using the Total Client Care assessment toolThe aim of this study was to evaluate a reliable valid assessment tool, Total Client Care (TCC) alongside a criterion reference approach to competency assessment within an undergraduate Nursing programme. The Total Client Care Assessment Tool aims to assess a student’s competence in an integrated way thereby mirroring the way in which registered nurses are expected to practice. TCC is a tool designed to assess the student’s ability to provide holistic care to a client over a specified period of time. TCC measured the student’s performance around four constructs, these are: Communication, Planning and Responding, Care Delivery and Assessing and Evaluating.   The TCC assessment tool is useful as it provides data about the student’s performance when providing actual care. When used as part of a wider system of assessment involving triangulation of evidence from a number of sources the tool can support mentor judgements about the achievement of competence. The tool and, the wider criterion referenced assessment process, can provide insight into students who may not be progressing as expected and thereby allow for earlier intervention to prevent failure.","approach, wider system, undergraduate nursing programme, care delivery, client care, tool, client care assessment"
"The limits and potentials of deep learning for roboticsThe application of deep learning in robotics leads to very specific problems and research questions that are typically not addressed by the computer vision and machine learning communities. In this paper we discuss a number of robotics-specific learning, reasoning, and embodiment challenges for deep learning. We explain the need for better evaluation metrics, highlight the importance and unique challenges for deep robotic learning in simulation, and explore the spectrum between purely data-driven and model-driven approaches. We hope this paper provides a motivating overview of important research directions to overcome the current limitations, and helps to fulfill the promising potentials of deep learning in robotics.","deep learning, embodiment challenges, limits, computer vision, roboticsthe application, promising potentials"
"Searching for Schiavoni intellectualsThe art history term of “Schiavoni”-used for artists born in Croatia, or Dalmatia, and active abroad, mostly in Italy-is completely absent from the Croatian literary history. No such history will, however, dare to omit the category of “Croatian authors outside their homeland”. The paper interprets the theoretical framework that is causing such discrepancy between the disciplines and proposes to consider both artists and writers as intellectuals. In that context, inspired by Antonio Gramsci’s theory of the role of intellectuals in the process of social change, the dynamic relationship between the intellectuals and the Schiavoni community can be fruitfully explored; for example, four intellectuals from the island of Korčula, active in the Schiavoni confraternity of St Jerome in Rome in 1550-1565, can be identified as a small social network strengthened by multiple alliances.","croatian literary history, antonio gramsci"
"Old russian apostolus from the XIVth century: the manuscript history and dialectal featuresThe article presents the research of an Old Russian copy of Apostolos (Tolstovskii Apostolus, National Library of Russia, QpI 5) yet recently dated by the end of the 13 th–the 14 th century. The codex stands out among other Old Russian written sources having a unique structure. It represents a full-text version (the continuous text type) of the Preslav recension. An online edition of the manuscript was accomplished at Kazan Federal University. This machine-readable publication is accompanied by various search modules and indexes and located on the “Kazan digital collection” page of the “Manuscript” portal. Recently, a hypothesis of the same provenance of this Apostolus and the Onega Psalter (precisely dated by 1395) has emerged. Besides, it is assumed that both manuscripts were produced at a Moscow scriptorium. The article critically examines these hypotheses describing the manuscripts’ history and comparing their handwritings, orthographic systems, and decoration. The study presents an analysis of regional characteristics of Tolstovskii Apostolus, which confirm its north-western origin and root relations with the book culture of the 14 th century. The analysis of the linguistic parameters of both codices was undertaken for the first time.","national library, kazan federal university, unique structure, manuscript, manuscript history, xivth century"
"A conversation rewound: Queer and racialized temporalities in HamiltonThe authors of this article, two educators and immigrants situated in the United States, consider the exigencies of listening to Hamilton: An American Musical. Shaped as dialogue, this article follows a previous piece where the authors processed their experience seeing Hamilton performed live. The current conversation shifts to the act of listening; it examines the ways in which the soundtrack embeds the audience into Lin-Manuel Miranda’s narrative, reinscribing the racialized immigrant body onto both Alexander Hamilton’s story, and Hamilton, the musical. Additionally, this article asks how the fictional Hamilton’s message to rise up and take a shot grants audience members a sense of agency and compels them to become present/future protagonists of a political story that seeks to write them off.","story, audience, united states, queer, conversation rewound, american musical"
"Frequency-specific brain dynamics related to prediction during language comprehensionThe brain9s remarkable capacity to process spoken language virtually in real time requires fast and efficient information processing machinery. In this study, we investigated how frequency-specific brain dynamics relate to models of probabilistic language prediction during auditory narrative comprehension. We recorded MEG activity while participants were listening to auditory stories in Dutch. Using trigram statistical language models, we estimated for every word in a story its conditional probability of occurrence. On the basis of word probabilities, we computed how unexpected the current word is given its context (word perplexity) and how (un)predictable the current linguistic context is (word entropy). We then evaluated whether source-reconstructed MEG oscillations at different frequency bands are modulated as a function of these language processing metrics. We show that theta-band source dynamics are higher in high relative to low entropy states, likely reflecting lexical computations. Beta-band dynamics are increased in situations of low word entropy and perplexity possibly reflecting maintenance of ongoing cognitive context. These findings lend support to the idea that the brain engages in the active generation and evaluation of predicted language based on the statistical properties of the input signal.","brain dynamics, probabilistic language prediction, spoken language, auditory narrative comprehension"
"Citizen contributions and minor heritage: feedback on modeling and visualising an information mash-upThe citizen science paradigm and the practices related to it have for the last decade called a wide attention, beyond academics, in many application fields with as a result a significant impact on discipline-specific research processes and on information sciences as such. Indeed, in the specific context of minor heritage (tangible and intangible cultural heritage assets that are left aside from large official heritage programs), citizen-birthed contributions appear as a major opportunity in the harvesting and enrichment of data sets (notwithstanding data quality and heterogeneity issues). In parallel, it seems we have today reached a moment when the acquisition and analysis of spatio-historical information appears ""easier"" since citizens are seen as potential (and legitimate) sensors. But is it really ""easier""? And if so, at what cost? Having a closer look on practical challenges behind the curtain can avoid turning the above mentioned opportunity into a lost one. In this contribution we present a research initiative that aims at better circumscribing the difficulties one has to foresee when wanting to harvest and visualize pieces of data on minor heritage collections, and then to derive from them spatial, temporal, and thematic knowledge. The contribution focuses on three aspects: a short analysis of citizen contributions in the context of minor heritage, a description of the case study and of the data modelling bottlenecks we are facing, and an exemplification of the visual analysis solutions we experiment in order to portray and question our understanding of collections. The case study acts as a test bench helping to investigate data harvesting and modelling …","analysis, minor heritage, contributions, spatiohistorical information, citizen contributions, specific context"
"Digital humanities as the historian’s Trojan horse: Response to commentary in the special section on digital history.The commentaries by Baldwin (2018), Green (2018), and Porter (2018) on the 2 articles (Burman, 2018; Flis & Van Eck, 2018) in this special section provide a unique perspective on digital humanities approaches to history of psychology. Each of the commentators approached the topic through their own lens—Melinda Baldwin as a historian of scientific journals, Christopher Green as a pioneer in digital history of psychology, and Ted Porter as a historian of quantification. In my response, I tried to reply to the 3 comments by critically discussing 4 themes the special section has raised: the relationship between digital history and conventional history, the perspective that takes databases as both sources for historians and objects in history, the relationship between “thick descriptions” and “thin” digital ones, and finally, the role of digital history as a type of a “trading creole” between scientists working in quantified …","historian, van eck, digital history, porter, unique perspective, digital humanities, trojan horse"
"Dynamic cities: Location-based accessibility modelling as a function of timeThe concept of accessibility–the potential of opportunities for interaction–binds together the key physical components of urban structure: people, transport and social activity locations. Most often these components are dynamic in nature and hence the accessibility landscape changes in space and time based on peoples mobilities and the temporality of the transport network and activity locations (eg services). Person-based accessibility approaches have been successful in incorporating time and space in the analyses and models. Still, the more broadly applied location-based accessibility modelling approaches have, on the other hand, often been static/atemporal in their nature. Here, we present a conceptual framework of dynamic location-based accessibility modelling that captures the dynamic temporality of all three accessibility components. Furthermore, we empirically test the proposed framework using novel …","components, dynamic cities, accessibility modelling"
"Cultural evolution of musicThe concept of cultural evolution was fundamental to the foundation of academic musicology and the subfield of comparative musicology, but largely disappeared from discussion after World War II, despite a recent resurgence of interest in cultural evolution in other fields. In this article, I draw on recent advances in the scientific understanding of cultural evolution to clarify persistent misconceptions about the roles of genes and progress in musical evolution and review literature relevant to musical evolution ranging from macroevolution of global song-style to microevolution of tune families. I also address criticisms regarding issues of musical agency, meaning, and reductionism, and highlight potential applications including music copyright, education, and sustainability. While cultural evolution will never explain all aspects of music in culture, it offers a useful theoretical framework for understanding diversity and change in the world’s music.","academic musicology, persistent misconceptions, cultural evolution, musical evolution, world war ii"
"A Storm in an IoT Cup: The Emergence of Cyber-Physical Social MachinesThe concept of ‘social machines’ is increasingly being used to characterise various socio-cognitive spaces on the Web. Social machines are human collectives using networked digital technology which initiate real-world processes and activities including human communication, interactions and knowledge creation. As such, they continuously emerge and fade on the Web. The relationship between humans and machines is made more complex by the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and devices. The scale, automation, continuous sensing, and actuation capabilities of these devices add an extra dimension to the relationship between humans and machines making it difficult to understand their evolution at either the systemic or the conceptual level. This article describes these new socio-technical systems, which we term Cyber-Physical Social Machines, through different exemplars, and considers the associated challenges of security and privacy.","storm, human collectives, social machinesthe, knowledge creation, machines, realworld processes, human communication, iot cup, social machines"
"Are NIH-funded publications fulfilling the proposed research? An examination of concept-matchedness between NIH research grants and their supported publicationsThe conceptual connections between scientific grants and publications are important, yet often overlooked in quantitative studies of science. An analysis of such connections could offer important insights into how science is conducted by individual researchers and research teams under the social and economic conditions of science. This study aims to offer the first piece of evidence towards this endeavor by analyzing the ratio of keyword matchedness between accepted NIH research grants from 2008 to 2015 and their funded publications. By applying linear regression method, we identified and examined three identified predictors of the outcome: 1) the funding rate of an NIH research program in a specific year, 2) the year difference between grant and publication, and 3) the funding size of a grant. Our findings suggest that these three factors contribute to the outcome in different capacities.

"Multiword units in machine translation and translation technologyThe correct interpretation of Multiword Units (MWUs) is crucial to many applications in Natural Language Processing but is a challenging and complex task. In recent years, the computational treatment of MWUs has received considerable attention but there is much more to be done before we can claim that NLP and Machine Translation (MT) systems process MWUs successfully. This volume provides a general overview of the field with particular reference to Machine Translation and Translation Technology and focuses on languages such as English, Basque, French, Romanian, German, Dutch and Croatian, among others. The chapters of the volume illustrate a variety of topics that address this challenge, such as the use of rule-based approaches, compound splitting techniques, MWU identification methodologies in multilingual applications, and MWU alignment issues.","machine translation, considerable attention, correct interpretation, multiword units, applications, computational treatment"

"Questioning ReasonThe debates over the nature of reason, and related ideas such as truth and knowledge, have a long history in African Philosophy (and before that, in anthropology) and have been well rehearsed in other places (Masolo 1994; Higgs 2001, 215-27; Stambach 2000; 341-52). The debate has largely centred around a well known, troubling tension. If, as I have previously argued, a great deal of African Philosophy has been focused on establishing that a set of philosophical practices are truly African and truly philosophical, the issue of reason presents a tension between the two. Didier Kaphagawani and Jeanette Malherbe put it succinctly:“... where the universalist denies that an African epistemology is possible, the relativist suggests that an African epistemology is just an empty term”(1998, 207).If we imagine a continuum on the nature of reason, from a universalist conception on the one hand to a particularist conception on the other (and indeed, framing this as a continuum already suggests that the two positions are not contradictories), we have problems at either end, and problems in the middle.

"Translating Data into Images: The Design Process for the Creation of VisualizationsThe design process is a series of endeavors aimed to solve a problem, which is extensively defined as a need, a task, a situation, etc. Visualizations are objects that result from a design process that solves a problem of unreadable data. They are technical mediators that transform data in graphics through a precise authorship that defines their social and political context. One way to understand visualizations is to analyze the process of design: this approach, applied to a case study called Affinity Map, unveils the complexity of an object and reveals the reasons of its creation.","design process, images, data, creation"
"Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS) as a platform for data and model integration: Cases in the field of water resources management and disaster risk reductionThe development of data and model integration platforms has furthered scientific inquiry and helped to solve pressing social and environmental problems. While several e-infrastructure platforms have been developed, the concept of data and model integration remains obscure, and these platforms have produced few firm results. This article investigates data and model integration on the Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS) platform, using three case projects from water-related fields. We provide concrete examples of data and model integration by analyzing the data transfer and analysis process, and demonstrate what platform functions are needed to promote the advantages of data and model integration. In addition, we introduce the Digital Object Identifier (DOI), a valuable tool for promoting data and model integration and open science. Our investigation reveals that DIAS advances data and model integration in five main ways: it is a"" sophisticated and robust integration platform""; has"" rich APIs, including a metadata management system, for high-quality data archive and utilization""; functions as a"" core hydrological model""; and promotes a"" collaborative R&D community"" and"" open science and data repositories"".

The idea that data transfer and real-time data analysis can enhance the quality of life for urban inhabitants is compelling, and one can easily envision the provision of exciting new services and applications that such an information- driven city could provide. The challenge in achieving a truly smart city stems largely from communications technologies -- fixed line, wireless, backhaul, and fronthaul -- and how these are combined to provide fast, reliable, and secure communications coverage.

"Sociotechnical Obstacles to Archaeological Data ReuseThe ease of digital data capture and the proliferation of concepts such as the “data deluge” suggest that modern researchers are drowning in datasets. Yet citations of archaeological datasets are few and far between, pointing to low rates of data reuse. This article explores the difficulties that surround data reuse in large-scale regional research, including the cost and coordination necessary to extract useful data from digitized PDF reports. The amount of correction and enhancement matches the effort needed to undertake a small field survey project and can only be circumvented with a thoughtful application of computer-assisted text analysis. Missing data in excavation report PDFs are not only intractable but also insidious due to their concealed nature, leading to poor outcomes in terms of (re) use. Consequently, the degree of data reuse in archaeology has been overestimated.","digital data capture, archaeological data, reusethe ease, data reuse, largescale regional research, sociotechnical obstacles"
"New Digital Worlds: Postcolonial Digital Humanities in Theory, Praxis, and PedagogyThe emergence of digital humanities has been heralded for its commitment to openness, access, and the democratizing of knowledge, but it raises a number of questions about omissions with respect to race, gender, sexuality, disability, and nation. Postcolonial digital humanities is one approach to uncovering and remedying inequalities in digital knowledge production, which is implicated in an information-age politics of knowledge. New Digital Worlds traces the formation of postcolonial studies and digital humanities as fields, identifying how they can intervene in knowledge production in the digital age. Roopika Risam examines the role of colonial violence in the development of digital archives and the possibilities of postcolonial digital archives for resisting this violence. Offering a reading of the colonialist dimensions of global organizations for digital humanities research, she explores efforts to decenter these institutions by emphasizing the local practices that subtend global formations and pedagogical approaches that support this decentering.

"Inducing Affective Lexical Semantics in Historical LanguageThe emotional connotation attached to words undergoes language change. In this paper, we aim at estimating the emotion which is associated with a given word in former language stages of English and German. Emotion is represented following the popular Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) annotation scheme. While being more expressive than polarity alone, existing word polarity induction methods are typically not suited for addressing it. To overcome this limitation, we present adaptations of two popular algorithms to VAD. To measure the effectiveness of these methods in diachronic settings, we present two small gold lexicons for historical word emotions which where annotated by scholars with proficiency in the respective language (stage). In contrast to claims in previous work, we find that limiting the training set to words of supposedly stable emotional meaning does in fact decrease performance, rather than boosting it. This contribution thus elaborates algorithmic and experimental results which form the basis of some of our later publications (Buechel et al., 2017; Buechel and Hahn, 2018; Hellrich et al., 2018) yet had to be skipped there, partly for brevity, partly for a change in focus of our work.Subjects: Computation and Language (cs.

"UGR ‘16: A new dataset for the evaluation of cyclostationarity-based network IDSsThe evaluation of algorithms and techniques to implement intrusion detection systems heavily rely on the existence of well designed datasets. In the last years, a lot of efforts have been done toward building these datasets. Yet, there is still room to improve. In this paper, a comprehensive review of existing datasets is first done, making emphasis on their main shortcomings. Then, we present a new dataset that is built with real traffic and up-to-date attacks. The main advantage of this dataset over previous ones is its usefulness for evaluating IDSs that consider long-term evolution and traffic periodicity. Models that consider differences in daytime/nighttime or weekdays/weekends can also be trained and evaluated with it. We discuss all the requirements for a modern IDS evaluation dataset and analyze how the one presented here meets the different needs.","intrusion detection systems, evaluation, ugr, new dataset, real traffic"
"Creativity vs quality: why the distinction matters when evaluating computational creativity systemsThe evaluation of computational creativity systems is increasingly becoming part of standard practice in computational creativity research, particularly with recent development in evaluation tools. One matter that can cause confusion, however, is in distinguishing between the concepts of creativity and quality/value. These two concepts are highly interrelated, to the point that it is difficult (and perhaps inappropriate) to define creativity without incorporat- ing quality judgements into that definition. Several examples exist, however, where creativity evaluation has been confused with quality judgments, leading to less grounded evaluative results. Many computational creativity projects aim to produce high quality results; this is a worthy research aim. If, however, the aim of a computational creativity research project is to make as creative a system as possible, then a more careful approach is needed that acknowledges and understands the differences - and also the overlaps - between creativity and quality. This paper critically investigates the concepts of creativity and quality (and how they are related). It offers warning examples showing the dangers of conflating the two concepts. These are followed by practical examples of how to incorporate value judgements into the evaluation of creativity of software, to further our overall pursuit of building more creative computational systems.","standard practice, computational, evaluation, computational creativity, judgements, computational creativity research, examples"
"ensemble named entity recognition (ner): evaluating ner Tools in the identification of Place names in historical corporaThe field of Spatial Humanities has advanced substantially in the past years. The identification and extraction of toponyms and spatial information mentioned in historical text collections has allowed its use in innovative ways, making possible the application of spatial analysis and the mapping of these places with Geographic Information Systems. For instance, automated place name identification is nowadays possible with Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems. Statistical NER methods based on supervised learning, in particular, are highly successful with modern datasets. However, there are still major challenges to address when dealing with historical corpora. These challenges include language changes over time, spelling variations, transliterations, OCR errors, and sources written in multiple languages among others. In this article, considering a task of place name recognition over two collections of historical correspondence, we report an evaluation of five NER systems and an approach that combines these through a voting system. We found that although individual performance of each NER system was corpus dependent, the ensemble combination was able to achieve consistent measures of precision and recall, outperforming the individual NER systems. Additionally, the results showed that these NER system are not strongly dependent on pre-processing and translation to modern English.","entity recognition, historical text collections, spatial information, ner systems, ner tools"
"Evidence for the Associated Production of a Single Top Quark and a Photon in Proton-Proton Collisions at The first evidence of events consistent with the production of a single top quark in association with a photon is reported. The analysis is based on proton-proton collisions at s= 13 TeV and recorded by the CMS experiment in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb− 1. Events are selected by requiring the presence of a muon (μ), a photon (γ), an imbalance in transverse momentum from an undetected neutrino (ν), and at least two jets (j) of which exactly one is identified as associated with the hadronization of a b quark. A multivariate discriminant based on topological and kinematic event properties is employed to separate signal from background processes. An excess above the background-only hypothesis is observed, with a significance of 4.4 standard deviations.

"The Historical Imaginary of Nineteenth-Century Style in David Mitchell’s Cloud AtlasThe first section of David Mitchell’s genre-bending novel, Cloud Atlas (2004), purports to be set in 1850. Narrative clues approximately date the intra-diegetic diary object of this chapter to the period 1851-1910. This article argues for the construction of a stylistic historical imaginary of this period’s language that is not based on mimetic etymological accuracy. Specifically, I show that of the 13,246 words in The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing, there are at least three terms that have an etymological first-usage date from after 1910: spillage, variously attested from ~1934; latino, from ~1946; and lazy-eye, from ~1960. Instead, I show that racist and colonial terms occur with much greater frequency in Cloud Atlas than in a broader contemporary textual corpus (the Oxford English Corpus), indicating that the construction of imagined historical style likely rests more on infrequent word use and thematic terms from outmoded racist discourses than on etymological mimesis.","broader contemporary textual corpus, nineteenthcentury style, david mitchell, intradiegetic diary object, narrative clues, racist, cloud atlas, historical imaginary"
"Temperature dependence (13–600 K) of Mn4+ lifetime in commercial Mg28Ge7. 55O32F15. 04 and K2SiF6 phosphorsThe fluorescence lifetime of the Mn4+2Eg→4A2g transition in commercial Mg28Ge7.55O32F15.04 (MFG) and K2SiF6 (KSF) phosphors are measured in the temperature region of 13–600 K. In MFG, the observed decrease in the lifetime with increasing temperature is correlated with increasing probability of phonon induced transitions (vibronic emission) without any contribution of nonradiative transitions. In KSF, the decrease in lifetime in the temperature region of 13–500 K is associated with an increase in the vibronic transition probability. Above 500 K, the rapid decrease in the lifetime is correlated with the onset of non-radiative relaxation.

"The Church of the Non-BelieversThe four atheologies—rationalist, scientific, moral, and civic—have a philosophical heritage as old as, if not older than, the formation of theology. Typical writings of atheology fall into one or another these four methods. Quite rare are thinkers who comprehensively advance all four atheologies during their careers. Rarer still are thinkers who coherently unite all four atheologies to work cooperatively together as a complete atheology.","typical writings, thinkers, nonbelieversthe, atheology"

"The struggle for existence in the world market ecosystemThe global trade system can be viewed as a dynamic ecosystem in which exporters struggle for resources: the markets in which they export. We can think that the aim of an exporter is to gain the entirety of a market share (say, car imports from the United States). This is similar to the objective of an organism in its attempt to monopolize a given subset of resources in an ecosystem. In this paper, we adopt a multilayer network approach to describe this struggle. We use longitudinal, multiplex data on trade relations, spanning several decades. We connect two countries with a directed link if the source country’s appearance in a market correlates with the target country’s disappearing, where a market is defined as a country-product combination in a given decade. Each market is a layer in the network. We show that, by analyzing the countries’ network roles in each layer, we are able to classify them as out-competing, transitioning or displaced. This classification is a meaningful one: when testing the future export patterns of these countries, we show that out-competing countries have distinctly stronger growth rates than the other two classes.","market, dynamic ecosystem, market ecosystemthe global trade, trade relations, multilayer network approach, struggle, export, car imports, country"
"Workshop on Barriers to Interactive IR Resources Re-useThe goal of this workshop is to serve as a starting point for a community-driven effort to design and implement a platform for the collection, organization, maintenance, and sharing of resources for IIR experimentation. As in all scientific endeavors, progress in IIR research is contingent on the ability to build on previous ideas, approaches, and resources. However, we believe there to be a number of barriers to reproducibility and re-use of resources in IIR research: the fragmentary nature of how the community» s resources are organized, the lack of awareness of their existence, documentation and organization of the resources, the nature of the typical research publication cycle, and the effort required to make such resources available. We believe that an online platform dedicated to the collection and organization of IIR resources could be a promising way of overcoming these barriers. The workshop therefore aims to …","barriers, iir research, workshop, communitydriven effort"
"Review of risk-based design for ice-class shipsThe growing interest for Arctic and Antarctic shipping activities due to the decreasing ice cover will also increase the risks of accidents on these waters. The design of ships for ice has traditionally been based on the practical experience without a clear link to the physics of the ship-ice interaction. The rules are, however, getting more towards the goal based approach, which require good knowledge of all the various element important for design. Risk based ship design (RBSD) is also widely applied e.g. for the passengers ships. Therefore, the scope of this paper is the review of the knowledge necessary for RBSD for Arctic conditions. The main focus is on ice loads and ship structures. Accident prevention and environmental consequences of oil spills are also discussed, but more briefly. In risk analysis, there is a recent focus on the treatment of uncertainty, or conversely, the strength of knowledge underlying the risk …","risk, practical experience, ice cover, iceclass shipsthe, design, knowledge"
"Historicizing transcultural psychiatry: people, epistemic objects, networks, and practicesThe history of transcultural psychiatry has recently attracted much historical attention, including a workshop in March 2016 in which an international panel of scholars met at the Maison de Sciences de l’Homme Paris-Nord (MSH-PN). Papers from this workshop are presented here. By conceiving of transcultural psychiatry as a dynamic social field that frames its knowledge claims around epistemic objects that are specific to the field, and by focusing on the ways that concepts within this field are used to organize intellectual work, several themes are explored that draw this field into the historiography of psychiatry. Attention is paid to the organization of networks and publications, and to important actors within the field who brought about significant developments in the colonial and post-colonial conceptions of mental illness.","maison de sciences, people, attention, international panel, epistemic objects, transcultural psychiatry"
"Introduction: Why authenticity still matters todayThe idea for this book came after a session organized by the editors at the 2015 Annual Meeting of the European Association of Archaeologists (EAA), entitled ‘Re-defining Authenticity in the Age of 3D Digital Reproductions’. The book includes contributions from some of the panellists attending the session and from invited scholars who have been working on the theme both theoretically and through specific projects. The general scope of this book is to introduce and discuss the epistemology of the concept of authenticity with the focus on how it can be defined and ‘achieved’through digital replicas. The challenge of this work is to analyse the concept from different perspectives and with different multi-disciplinary contributions, together with theoretical debate. This volume represents the first attempt to collate an organic collection of contributions on authenticity and the digital realm in heritage and archaeology. Why authenticity? This is a much debated concept as it is assumed today that authenticity is defined by Western views of heritage. To study the etymology of the term, in a fascinating paper Lionel Trilling (1973, ii) goes back to the medieval term sincerity:‘Before authenticity had come along to suggest the deficiencies of sincerity and to usurp its place in our esteem, sincerity stood high in the cultural firmament and had dominion over men’s imagination of how they ought to be’. Long debates on how heritage should be defined have brought authenticity into play. While organizations such as ICOMOS and UNESCO (to name just two of the best-known) have institutionalized the term, conflicting and sometimes more decentralized views have …","digital realm, views, general scope, book, digital replicas"
"Inclusion zoneThe idea of the modern professions was born out of the first industrial revolution and the need to organize expertise in ways to suit an increasingly mechanized and mobile society with new divisions of labour, sources of power and cheaply available print communication. The second industrial revolution, founded on electricity, oil and telecommunications, took off at the start of the 20th century and remoulded the professional idea to suit a mass society run by a centralized and bureaucratic state, but largely predicated on high growth and individual opportunity. It was ideally suited for the new, adapted version of professionalism to thrive. There was a substantial increase in the proportion of the workforce that described itself as professional and many new occupations took on the organizational and institutional trappings of the professional system.","modern professions, mobile society, idea, new divisions, inclusion"

This document can be read as call to action addressed to all actors in the public and private sectors, as well as a pleading oriented towards the markets to open up to this trend. That is why, workable solutions (bio-economy strategies, good management practices, communication tools) for the organizations from the Danube Region must be available in order to capitalize on the potential of the region.","adequate innovation frameworks, bioeconomy actors, timely policy, online support, bioeconomy strategy, financial interventions"
"Automated Sentence Boundary Detection in Modern Standard Arabic Transcripts using Deep Neural Networks.The increased volumes of Arabic sources of data available on the Web has boosted the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools over different tasks and applications. However, to take advantage from a vast amount of these applications, a prior segmentation task call Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD) is needed. In this paper we focus on SBD over Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) by comparing two different approaches based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) using out-of-domain and in-domain training data with only lexical features (represented as character embedding) while conducting two scenarios based on a Convolutional Neural Network and a Recurrent Neural Network with attention mechanism architectures. While tuning a big out-of-domain dataset with a smaller in-domain dataset, improves the performance in general.

"American Woman: Feminine Speech and the Reformation of National Identity Through Female Community in louisa May Alcott’s An Old-Fashioned GirlThe insecurity of American identity in the years immediately after the Civil War added to fears about the dissolution of a simple, “old-fashioned” American past. Louisa May Alcott in particular worries about the Frenchified influence of “The Girl of the Period,” a fear that she addresses in An Old-Fashioned Girl (1870). After the Civil War, Alcott saw an opportunity for women to play an essential part in the creation of a revised American identity. This article argues that the “Old-Fashioned Girl” embodies what Alcott sees as a more American value system while inspiring cultural and social change. In contrast to Republican motherhood, in which women gain power through influencing their husbands and sons, Alcott emphasizes a rhizomatic female community where women gain power through their influence on and support of other women. Furthermore, the old-fashioned girl crosses age and class boundaries by building …","female community, oldfashioned girl, feminine speech, american identity, american woman, national identity, rhizomatic female community, influence, civil war, women, louisa"
"Between parental power and marital authority: How merchant women stood the test of customary laws in Brittany in the sixteenth to seventeenth centuriesThe interest of a study of the duchy of Brittany in the sixteenth century rests firstly on the fact that, compared to other regions of France, women commoners had equal rights there and noble women were extremely advantaged: whether filles seules2 (unmarried girls), married or widowed, they could act with full legal capacity within a particular framework. Secondly, the duchy, with an imposing maritime frontage, stands out with its economic activities related to the sea; the place of women is noticeable because they participated in national trade and in international trade made by the main ports of the maritime coastline such as Nantes (Michon 2011) and Saint-Malo (Lespagnol 1991); they owned shops and also salt marshes and shares in ships; they invested in maritime trade. 3 Lastly, on the real property market, Brittany had a singular procedure called appropriance par bannies (appropriation by ban), enabling men …","marital authority, sixteenth century, maritime frontage, customary laws, merchant women, parental power, equal rights"
"Expressing Multimedia Content Using Semantics—A VisionThe introduction of streaming and VoD platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, and Youtube, has presented the film industry with a new way for how they can deliver their product to their audience. This has seen a rise in online videos and subsequently has made it harder for viewers to discover the right visual content for them. Traditional video search tools enable users to find visual content based on various metadata fields, such as genre or title, however, this information might not accurately represent the actual content in the movie. In this position paper we describe our idea of leveraging the richness of semantic technologies to (1) enrich movie metadata, and (2) create meaningful semantically-enriched descriptions of movie scenes using a variety of video and audio processing techniques. This information will enable us to create a Knowledge Graph (KG), which will be interlinked with other KGs available on the Web of …","metadata, film industry, visual content, multimedia content, movie"
"Specificity in English for Academic Purposes (EAP): A Corpus Analysis of Lexical Bundles in Academic WritingThe issue of specificity in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) settings has always challenged linguists and instructors in the field to take a stance on how language should be perceived, that is whether language forms and features are transferable across different academic disciplines or are specific to particular disciplines. This study intends to take this debate a step further by employing a corpus-driven method in identifying a type of phraseological sequence, namely lexical bundles in a corpus of journal articles in the field of International Business Management (IBM). The lexical bundles were compared with those compiled by Simpson-Vlach and Ellis (2010) in their study of Academic Formulas List (AFL) to determine the specificity of the lexical bundles identified in this study. Following frequency-based approach, the corpus tool, Collocate 1.0 was used to extract three-to five-word sequences. These word sequences were manually filtered to exclude irrelevant and meaningless combinations. The qualified lexical bundles were compiled and compared with lexical bundles in AFL (Simpson-Vlach and Ellis 2010) using log-likelihood test. The findings show that three-word lexical bundles are the most common types of lexical bundles in IBM corpus. The comparison reveals that lexical bundles in IBM corpus are relatively specific as compared with lexical bundles in AFL. A discipline-specific approach to the teaching and learning of lexical bundles in EAP settings is therefore advocated to enhance EAP syllabuses and instruction.","lexical bundles, corpus analysis, specificity, disciplines, ibm corpus, academic purposes, settings"
"Swinging Triples: Bridging Jazz Performance Datasets using Linked DataThe jazz performance metadata prototype JazzCats: Jazz Collection of Aggregated Triples uses Linked Data to bridge four discrete jazz music datasets: Linked Jazz, with prosopographical and interpersonal information about musicians; the Weimar Jazz Database (WJazzD), containing musicological metadata; a discography of the jazz standard Body&Soul; and J-DISC, a fourth independent but complementary and extensive discographic project. Through the use of custom-built ontological structures the data, originally stored in various different information structures, has been converted to RDF and merged together in a single triplestore. The result is a new digital resource that can be used to support and enrich scholarship and research in musicology and performance studies.","linked data, aggregated triples, swinging triples, jazz collection, information, musicological metadata, jazz performance"

Enhancing Usability for Automatically Structuring Digitised DictionariesThe last decade has seen a rapid development of the number of NLP tools which have been made available to the community. The usability of several e-lexicography tools represents a serious obstacle for researchers with little or no background in computer science. We present in this paper our efforts to overcome this issue in the case of a machine learning system for the automatic segmentation and semantic annotation of digitised dictionaries. Our approach is based on limiting the burdens of managing the tools setup in different execution environments and lightening the complexity of the training process. We illustrate the possibility to reach this goal through the adaptation of existing functionalities and through using out of the box software deployment technology. We also report on the communitys feedback after exposing the new setup to real users of different professional backgrounds.,"tools, rapid development, enhancing usability"
"Spectroscopy of Mn4+ in orthorhombic perovskite, LaInO3The low temperature spectroscopic properties of Mn4+ (3d3) in the orthorhombic perovskite, LaInO3, is examined in this work. The exchange charge model of crystal-field theory is used to calculate the Mn4+ energy levels. The spectra can be fitted by the parameters Dq = 1776 cm−1, B = 700 cm−1 and C = 3189 cm−1, with C/B = 4.5. Discussions pertaining to the low luminescence efficiency of LaInO3:Mn4+ are presented. A comparative study of the variations in the energy of the 2Eg→4A2g emission transition in a series of materials with the perovskite structure is presented. The data suggest a relationship between the energy of the 2Eg→4A2g emission transition and the deviation of the octahedral O-Mn-O bond angle from the ideal 90°. It is concluded that the angular distortion is not large enough to support the development of high luminosity Mn4+ activated phosphors in the ABO3 perovskite family of …","emission, exchange charge model, mn4, energy levels, orthorhombic perovskite, spectroscopy, crystalfield theory"
"The dataLegend ecosystem for historical statisticsThe main promise of the digital humanities is the ability to perform scholarly studies at a much broader scale, and in a much more reusable fashion. The key enabler for such studies is the availability of sufficiently well described data. For the field of socio-economic history, data usually comes in a tabular form. Existing efforts to curate and publish datasets take a top-down approach and are focused on large collections, produce scarce metadata, require expertise for effective integration, provide poor user support while producing mappings, and present issues at data access. This paper presents the datalegend platform, which addresses the long tail of research data by catering for the needs of individual scholars. datalegend allows researchers to publish their (small) datasets, link them to existing vocabularies and other datasets, and thereby contribute to a growing collection of interlinked datasets.

"Fennesz: Endless Summer (2003)The main purpose of this book was to present Vienna Electronica, a little-known phenomenon in the history of popular music, whose heyday was in the 1990s. I considered it from several perspectives. Firstly, I located it in the long tradition of music produced and consumed in Vienna, including classical music from this city, composed by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert, which is probably the most revered music in the world, as well as music of Strauss, Mahler, Schoenberg and popular music produced after the Second World War. I did this to gauge whether living and working in the shadow of such musical giants as Haydn and Mozart, is conducive to gaining national and international recognition by contemporary musicians from Vienna or rather condemns them to an inferior status. Secondly, I tried to account for how factors pertaining to some wider trends in the production and dissemination of music, such …","vienna electronica, littleknown phenomenon, endless summer, popular music"
"Games as Blends: Understanding Hybrid GamesThe meaning of what hybrid games are is often fixed to the context in which the term is used. For example, hybrid games have often been defined in relation to recent developments in technology. This creates issues in the terms usage and limitations in thinking. This paper argues that hybrid games should be understood through conceptual metaphors. Hybridity is the blending of different cognitive domains that are not usually associated together. Hybrid games usually blend domains related to games, for example digital and board games, but can blend also other domains. Through viewing game experiences as blends from different domains, designers can understand the inherent hybridity in various types of games and use that understanding when building new designs.","blends, hybrid games, hybridity"
"Collecting the past: Manuscript and book collecting in the nineteenth and twentieth centuriesThe nineteenth and twentieth centuries were a great age of manuscript and book collecting in Britain and North America. Many of the best-known collectors were active in this period, and several of them founded significant libraries or museums which perpetuate and memorialize their collections to the present day. The turnover of manuscripts alone was at a very high level; the Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts records almost 100,000 transactions through auctions and sales catalogues during this time. 1 This volume, which has its origins in a conference held in 2016 at the Institute of English Studies, School of Advanced Study, University of London, brings together essays on a selection of key people involved in collecting books and manuscripts during this period.

"Data from: Polygyny without wealth: popularity in gift games predicts polygyny in BaYaka PygmiesThe occurrence of polygynous marriage in hunter–gatherer societies, which do not accumulate wealth, remains largely unexplored since resource availability is dependent on male hunting capacity and limited by the lack of storage. Hunter–gatherer societies offer the greatest insight in to human evolution since they represent the majority of our species evolutionary history. In order to elucidate the evolution of hunter–gatherer polygyny, we study marriage patterns of BaYaka Pygmies. We investigate (i) rates of polygyny among BaYaka hunter–gatherers; (ii) whether polygyny confers a fitness benefit to BaYaka men; (iii) in the absence of wealth inequalities, what are the alternative explanations for polygyny among the BaYaka. To understand the latter, we explore differences in phenotypic quality (height and strength), and social capital (popularity in gift games). We find polygynous men have increased reproductive fitness; and that social capital and popularity but not phenotypic quality might have been important mechanisms by which some male hunter–gatherers sustained polygynous marriages before the onset of agriculture and wealth accumulation.","pygmiesthe occurrence, polygyny, gift games, bayaka hunter, gatherer societies, data, polygynous marriage, fitness"
"Couples Who Slay Together, Stay Together: Benefits, Challenges, and Relational Quality among Romantic Couples Who GameThe old adage “couples that play together, stay together” is based on elementary understandings of how romantic relationships work. However, evidence suggests that engaging in joint activities as a romantic couple is a contributing factor to relational health (Canary & Stafford, 1992). Specifically, literature on relational maintenance demonstrates that spending time together engaging in joint activities, especially leisure activities, is positively related to relational satisfaction (Canary et al., 1993). Considering the recent exponential growth in the gaming industry (Entertainment Software Association, 2013), it should come as no surprise that a growing number of couples are spending their leisure time literally “playing together”(Carr & Oliver, 2009; Huynh, Lim & Skoric, 2013; Nardi, 2010; Williams et al., 2009). Existing research on couples’ play is largely based on a single gaming genre, namely massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs). Emerging genres such as the increasingly popular multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs) have been studied less often overall, especially in terms of relational behaviors and outcomes. In an effort to contribute to this significant body of literature, the current study examines couples’ play through a number of theoretical frameworks from both the game studies and interpersonal communication disciplines. Specifically, the current study provides a unique look into the relational processes of players, including insights on relational maintenance behaviors and the benefits and challenges couples face when gaming together.","challenges, romantic couples, relational maintenance, relational health, challenges couples, leisure"
"The narrowing field: The interrelationship of systems librarian training & ILS marketplace consolidationThe ongoing consolidation of the integrated library system vendor environment, coupled with the increased shift towards closed remotely hosted software options, has created a situation in which librarians can no longer evaluate the technology that serves as the primary infrastructure for library service. This shift, coupled with inadequate preparation for systems librarians through LIS graduate coursework, sets the stage for a future in which librarians’ professional values of openness and equity will stand at odds with the necessary choices in library software providers. Advocacy and professional development through organizations dedicated to technology in libraries, and open source development, may help to prevent the total loss of institutional autonomy.","library, systems librarians, software, lis graduate coursework, ongoing consolidation, ils marketplace"
"How hot is .brussels? Analysis of the uptake of the .brussels top-level domain name extensionThe opening up of the top-level domain name market in 2012 has offered new perspectives for companies, administrations and individuals to include a geographic component within the domain name of their website. Little to no research has been carried out since then to analyse the uptake of the new top-level domain names (TLDNs). Based on the specific case of the TLDN .brussels, this article proposes an empirical study of how the opening up of the top-level domain name market actually impacts registration practices. By making use of freely available software tools such as OpenRefine and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, the entire corpus of the .brussels domain names (6 300) was analysed from a quantitative perspective. Based on a statistically representative sample (592 domain names), a qualitative interpretation allowed a more fine-grained analysis of how the new TLDN is being used in practice. By doing so, the article gives detailed insight into the impact of the recent changes to the rules concerning domain name registration. Through this analysis, researchers, policy makers, investors and anyone concerned about the identity of Brussels in the digital realm may have a better understanding of the state of play of the .brussels TLDN.","analysis, new perspectives, registration practices, natural language processing, geographic component"

"Corpus-based approach to the extraction of the emotional concepts and their ontological relations using the natural language logic operatorsThe paper deals with the identification, extraction and cross-linguistic comparison of the emotion concepts and their relationship with other material, psychological and socio-cultural concepts. What are the salient semantic domains and conceptual structures of the linguistic construals that are used to express emotions as entities (nouns), processes (verbs) and properties (adjectives, adverbs) in the communication? The methodology of this ontological corpus-based study includes three phases. The first phase deals with the construction of the Ontological Model of Concepts and Linguistic Constructions database that aims to formalize the meta-data about the ontological features of the psychological concepts and their relation with material and socio-cultural concepts. The ontological model is theoretically grounded in the system theory (Emmeche et al. 1997, Baas & Emmeche 1997, El-Hani & Emmeche 2000, Searle 2006, Capra & Luisi 2014), and cognitive approaches to the categorization (Rosch 2005). The ontological model is stored in a graph property database Neo4j (https://neo4j. com/). The second phase includes the extraction of the nominal, adjectival and processual lexical concepts related to the psychological phenomena from the large corpuses of Croatian (hrWaC 2.2) and English (enTenTen13) using the SketchEngine API and UDPipe (http://ufal. mff. cuni. cz/udpipe) tokenizer and parser.

"More than Virtualization: Cultoromics or a New Discovery of the Cultural GenomeThe paper explores the American neologism of culturomics, coined on December 16, 2010 by the Harvardian research tandem of Jean-Baptiste Michel and Erez Lieberman Aiden for their article on a “Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books.” In computer linguistics, it denotes an abbreviated, interdisciplinary amalgam of the words culture and genomics, and such a correct explanation of the notion was provided by the authors themselves, as well as by The Wall Street Journal linguistic columnist Ben Zimmer on December 23, 2010. However, the paper notes that the distinguished British linguist David Crystal associated it with economics and ergonomics, as did most of the readers, although the authentic American suffix is not -onomics but rather the bioscientific and neologistic -omics, whereas Michel and Aiden describe genomics as a study of organisms and their genomes, that is, their integral deoxyribonucleic sequences. Exemplified by a Google Books n-gram search pertaining to an American English usage frequency of the notion of “Croatia” from 1990 to 2008, the paper analyzes a scientific deployment of the new realizations and the development of software facilitating a machine retrieval of a spoken, written, or of a symbolic natural language, thus synthesizing a computerized theory and artificial intelligence with a cognitive psychology, linguistics, and logic to interactively correct or translate the texts and extract information. What is more, such an approach is also observable in a contemporary algorithmic speech synthesis, data mining, search engines, or in text compressors.

We extract information from the critical apparatus and supplement it with some new additional markups that enable visualizing the evolution of Tolstoy as a publicist. We show that the named entity index constitutes a valuable knowledge base, which can serve as a basis for generating a knowledge graph that is more detailed and systematic than the open linked databases like DBpedia.","knowledge discoverythe, critical print edition, semantic markup, digital edition, knowledge"

The conference confirmed the opportunity for a strong synergy between the library community and the Wikipedian community (represented on this occasion by many members of AIB and Wikimedia Italia) and for a common commitment to the dissemination of knowledge, open access to information and the free reuse of digital resources in the public domain. Starting from the felt need for a regulatory framework on intellectual property that improves free knowledge and the role of cultural institutions, the speakers discussed various forms of interaction with the Wikimedia world, activated by some Italian institutions (BNCF, Municipal Library of Trento, University of Turin) and the peculiar interest that each of the platforms of free knowledge has in the eyes of librarians. Pointed references are to Wikisource (the multilingual digital library, which cotains texts in the public domain), Wikipedia (which already ‘talks’ with the New Soggettario Thesaurus), Wikimedia Commons (where there is an increasing number of digitized resources from libraries) but above all to Wikidata, the free and collaborative knowledge base, enriched in recent times by a large amount of bibliographic data, also thanks to the WikiCite project.

"Identification of a Novel Clinical Phenotype of Severe Malaria using a Network-Based Clustering ApproachThe parasite Plasmodium falciparum is the main cause of severe malaria (SM). Despite treatment with antimalarial drugs, more than 400,000 deaths are reported every year, mainly in African children. The diversity of clinical presentations associated with SM highlights important differences in disease pathogenesis that often require specific therapeutic options. The clinical heterogeneity of SM is largely unresolved. Here we report a network-based analysis of clinical phenotypes associated with SM in 2,915 Gambian children admitted to hospital with Plasmodium falciparum malaria. We used a network-based clustering method which revealed a strong correlation between disease heterogeneity and mortality. The analysis identified four distinct clusters of SM and respiratory distress that departed from the WHO definition.

"The need for global studiesThe past few decades have seen a rapid increase in the availability and use of large music corpora. However, most music corpus studies remain limited to Western music, limiting our ability to understand the diversity and unity of human music throughout the world. I argue for the potential of cross-cultural corpus studies to contribute to comparative musicological studies in domains including music classification, evolution, universals, and human history. I highlight and discuss a number of important cross-cultural corpora, including the Berlin Phonogramm-Archiv, CompMusic Project, Essen Folksong Collection, Cantometrics Project, Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, Natural History of Song, and Deep History of Music projects. In the process, I discuss the pros and cons of music notation vs. recordings, automatic vs. manual analysis, regional vs. global analysis, and associated challenges regarding choosing appropriate analysis methods that can allow meaningful comparison across cultures.

The alteration of a singular national space into two separate nation-states based on religious identities forced the movement of almost twelve million people, in search of a new homeland. Although this exodus was experienced differently based on socio-economic backgrounds—unfortunately in ways akin to any violent transition—women formed the most susceptible ground to the rigours of the Partition. Gross and barbarous acts of violence perpetuated against women were derived from a hypermasculinized nationalist ideology: one that perceived women’s bodies as sites where national and religious identities needed to be forcibly inscribed. Partition historiography, however, has frequently privileged only the political circumstances and elided the …","religious identities, human history, partition rehabilitation camps, nonplaces, singular national space, separate nationstates"
"Media Pride and Prejudices of Transmedial Traffic: Enacting Jane Austen with Zombies.The present paper uses theories of interand transmediality to repurpose the traditional relationship between classic books and their cinematic adaptations. It asserts the need for literary scholarship to go beyond the traditional protectionism of the literary medium, here dubbed"" media pride"", and to tap into the interest that feeds consumption of mash-ups and parodies of the great books for alternative media. Instead of a competitive relationship between related objects (the book, the movie, the graphic novel, the game, etc.), the paper proposes a remedial approach, where the same objects can coexist and actively contribute to each others reception. The case study is an analysis of Jane Austens novel Pride and Prejudice, Seth Grahame-Smiths mash-up novel Pride and Prejudice and Zombies and Burr Steers adaptation for screen of the latter.","media pride, transmedial traffic, objects, jane austen, classic books, interand transmediality, traditional relationship"

"ActionTrip: automating egocentric video production through gestural interaction and landmark awarenessThe proliferation of smartphones with video recording and action cameras has empowered users to effortlessly capture everyday moments and activities in video format. This process often results into long video sequences that need to be edited down and summarized in order to be properly archived, shared within social media, or simply projected to family and friends. For those who do not possess video-editing skills, isolating the most appropriate moments is a difficult and time-consuming task. This work presents"" ActionTrip"", a system that provides gestural user interaction during video-capture, in order to seamlessly tag personal points of interest.

"Diurnal variations of psychometric indicators in Twitter contentThe psychological state of a person is characterised by cognitive and emotional variables which can be inferred by psychometric methods. Using the word lists from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, designed to infer a range of psychological states from the word usage of a person, we studied temporal changes in the average expression of psychological traits in the general population. We sampled the contents of Twitter in the United Kingdom at hourly intervals for a period of four years, revealing a strong diurnal rhythm in most of the psychometric variables, and finding that two independent factors can explain 85% of the variance across their 24-h profiles. The first has peak expression time starting at 5am/6am, it correlates with measures of analytical thinking, with the language of drive (e.g power, and achievement), and personal concerns. It is anticorrelated with the language of negative affect and social concerns. The second factor has peak expression time starting at 3am/4am, it correlates with the language of existential concerns, and anticorrelates with expression of positive emotions. Overall, we see strong evidence that our language changes dramatically between night and day, reflecting changes in our concerns and underlying cognitive and emotional processes. These shifts occur at times associated with major changes in neural activity and hormonal levels.","psychological state, psychological traits, concerns, psychometric methods, word usage, diurnal variations, word lists, average expression, psychometric indicators, word count, linguistic inquiry"

"Challenges of measuring the impact of software: an examination of the lme4 R packageThe rise of software as a research object is mirrored in the increasing interests towards quantitative studies of scientific software. However, due to the inconsistent practice of citing software, most of the existing studies analyzing the impact of scientific software are based on identification of software name mentions in full-text publications. Despite its limitations, citation data have a much larger quantity and broader coverage of scientific fields than full-text data and thus could support findings in much larger scopes. This paper presents an analysis aiming to evaluate the extent to which citations data can be used to reconstruct the impact of software. Specifically, we identified the variety of citable objects related to the lme4 R package and examined how the packages impact is scattered across these objects. Our results reveal a little-discussed challenge of using citation data to measure the impact of software, that even within the category of formal citation, there might be different forms in which the same software object is cited. This challenge can be mitigated by more carefully selecting objects as the proxy of software. However, it cannot be fully solved until we have one-software-one-proxy policy for software citation.Subjects: Digital Libraries (cs. DL)Cite as: arXiv: 1811.11270 cs. DL(or arXiv: 1811.11270 v1 cs.

As research into social media and mass media has grown with the ability to leverage Internet-based resources, this article approaches the increased security climate in the United States and Islamophobia through film analysis of non-Western films. Geographies of film have been well developed within the context of geopolitics, but less so in the analysis of non-Western film industries such as Bollywood. We argue that non-Western film analysis is crucial to understanding changing political climates and challenges the lines between representation and the everyday. We focus on three films in the world’s biggest film industry to analyze intimacy and the role of the body within discourse in film.

By modeling the encounter with climate as one characterized by distraction, David Mitchell’s novel The Bone Clocks proposes that the difficulty in portraying climate change arises not from displaced effects and protracted timescales but a failure of attention. The book both describes and enacts the way more traditionally dramatic stories distract from climate connections right in front of our eyes, revealing, in the end, that the real story was climate all along.

"Dorsal raphé nucleus glucocorticoid receptors inhibit tph2 gene expression in male C57BL/6J miceThe serotonergic dorsal raphé nucleus (DRN) expresses glucocorticoid receptors (GR), and systemic glucocorticoids have been shown to regulate expression and activity of tryptophan hydroxylase isoform 2, the rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin synthesis in brain. We have used intra-DRN injection of pseudotyped adeno-associated virus AAV2/9 transducing either green fluorescent protein (GFP control) or Cre recombinase (DRN GR deletion) in floxed GR mice to determine if DRN GR directly regulate DRN mRNA levels of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (tph2). In a separate set of similarly-treated floxed GR mice, we also measured limbic forebrain region concentrations of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) and its major metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). DRN GR deletion increased tph2 mRNA levels in the dorsal, lateral wing, and caudal parts of the DRN without altering tissue concentrations of 5-HT …","glucocorticoid, micethe, serotonergic dorsal raphé nucleus, drn gr, expression, floxed gr mice, gene expression"
"Propionic acid promotes the virulent phenotype of Crohns disease-associated adherent-invasive Escherichia coliThe short chain fatty acid propionic acid (PA) is a bacteria-derived human intestinal antimicrobial and immune modulator used widely in Western food production and agriculture. Here we examine the effect of PA on the pathogenicity of the Crohns disease-associated microbe, adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC). Passage of AIEC through a murine model, where the low intestinal PA levels were increased to replicate those of the human intestine, led to the recovery of AIEC post-infection that had significantly increased virulence. These phenotypic changes, including increased adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells and biofilm formation, could be replicated in AIEC in vitro through exposure to PA alone. This in vitro exposure of AIEC to PA fundamentally changed AIEC virulence, with strains exposed to PA in vitro subsequently persisting at 20-fold higher levels in a murine model compared to non-exposed strains. RNA-sequencing identified the transcriptional changes in AIEC in response to PA with upregulation of genes involved in biofilm formation, stress responses, metabolism, membrane integrity and alternative carbon source utilisation. These PA induced changes in virulence could be replicated in a number of E. coli isolates from Crohns disease patients. Finally, removal of the PA selective pressure was sufficient to reverse these phenotypic changes.  Our data indicate that exposure of AIEC to PA evolves bacteria that are both resistant to this natural human intestinal antimicrobial and increasingly virulent in its presence.","propionic acid, adherentinvasive escherichia coli, immune modulator, virulent phenotype, western food production"
"Deep Learning for Logic Optimization AlgorithmsThe slowing down of Moores law and the emergence of new technologies puts an increasing pressure on the field of EDA. There is a constant need to improve optimization algorithms. However, finding and implementing such algorithms is a difficult task, especially with the novel logic primitives and potentially unconventional requirements of emerging technologies. In this paper, we cast logic optimization as a deterministic Markov decision process (MDP). We then take advantage of recent advances in deep reinforcement learning to build a system that learns how to navigate this process. Our design has a number of desirable properties. It is autonomous because it learns automatically and does not require human intervention. It generalizes to large functions after training on small examples. Additionally, it intrinsically supports both single- and multi-output functions, without the need to handle special cases.

"Data scopes for digital history researchThe term Macroscope has recently been introduced as an instrument to study historical big data using digital tools. In this paper we argue the need for a more elaborate set of concepts to describe and reason about the interactions to select, enrich, connect, analyse and evaluate historical data using digital tools. Interactions change the data and are essential in understanding any subsequent analysis. It makes them part of historical research methodology, but there is little consensus on how these steps can or should be performed. Moreover, they are rarely reported and discussed. We introduce the term data scope as an instrument encompassing these choices and interactions. Elaborating on these processes encourages deeper reflection on and discussion of the interactions and their consequences for research outcomes.","subsequent analysis, elaborate set, deeper reflection, digital tools, data scopes"
"Modeling in the Digital Humanities: a Research Program?The term modeling is used in so many different research fields that the assumption that they are all conceptually connected seems quite hard to defend.

"5 Modeling space in historical textsThe texts used as sources in the humanities tend to be rich in information about place and space. Much of the information about place in such sources comes directly from the place-names mentioned in them. However, some come indirectly through more ambiguous, descriptive geographical references, as in the phrases “near the hills” or “beyond the town.” In either case, the spatial information can be difficult for a human reader to conceptualize effectively. Even when a reader is familiar with the area described, identifying the location of the places to which that source refers and conceptualizing how those places relate to one another can be difficult; when the reader is unfamiliar with the area it is all but impossible. Beyond this, gaining an in-depth understanding of the way that different places are represented with a text often requires the places to be represented or modeled in non-textual form. One solution to this problem is to map the places to which the source refers. The effectiveness of this approach has been explored elsewhere (see, for example, Moretti, 1998). However, manually mapping textual information is time-consuming and the resulting maps are inflexible and, therefore, have only limited analytical potential.Digital technologies present new opportunities for modeling, analyzing and interpreting the geographical information contained within texts. This chapter will explore some of these opportunities, focusing particularly on the modeling, analysis and interpretation of geographical information in texts, and on the difficulties of integrating space in textual analysis. Although texts are a particularly rich source of geographical information …","modeling space, space, historical textsthe texts, reader, source, geographical information"

"NLP Corpus Observatory – Looking for constellations in parallel corpora to improve learners’ collocational skills.The use of corpora in language learning, both in classroom and self-study situations, has proven useful. Investigations into technology use show a benefit for learners that are able to work with corpus data using easily accessible technology. But relatively little work has been done on exploring the possibilities of parallel corpora for language learning applications.Our work described in this paper explores the applicability of a parallel corpus enhanced with several layers generated by NLP techniques for extracting collocations that are noncompositional and thus indispensable to learn. We identify constellations, ie combinations of intra-and interlingual relations, calculate association scores on each relation and, based thereon, a joint score for each constellation. This way, we are able to find relevant collocations for different types of constellations.","language learning applications, collocations, corpus, selfstudy situations, technology, language learning, nlp corpus observatory, parallel corpora"

"Conceptual metonymy: Methodological, theoretical, and descriptive issuesThe volume addresses a number of closely connected methodological, descriptive, and theoretical issues in the study of metonymy, and includes a series of case studies broadening our knowledge of the functioning of metonymy. As regards the methodological and descriptive issues, the book exhibits a unique feature in metonymy literature: the discussion of the structure of a detailed, web-based metonymy database (especially its entry model), and the descriptive criteria to be applied in its completion. The theoretical discussion contributes important challenging insights on several metonymy-related topics such as contingency, source prominence,“complex target”, source-target contrast/asymmetry, conceptual integration, hierarchies, triggers, de-personalization and de-roling, and many others. The case studies deal with the role of metonymy in morphology, monoclausal if only constructions, emotional categories, and iconicity in English and other languages, including one sign language. Beside cognitive linguists, especially metonymy researchers, the book should appeal to researchers in AI, sign language, rhetoric, lexicography, and communication.","sign language, conceptual metonymy, discussion, unique feature, issuesthe, descriptive"

"Can Software Engineering be Taught by Making (and) Music? a proposed empirical studyThe work proposed here centres on materializing core concepts of software engineering (e.g. version management, architecture, the interplay between functional and non-functional requirements, the need to think at both small and large scale simultaneously, user interaction and design constraints, as well as project management) in design thinking through the creation of physical instruments, and their subsequent translation (by introducing the crucial engineering concepts of abstraction and abstract representation) into a combination of software-based digital instruments with physical controllers. The hope is that by doing so, the thinking skills that benefit software engineering (beyond programming) can be developed through physical, not just mental practice. More broadly, students can engage with other aspects of their curriculum (physics, art, design etc) and bring these to bear in an integrated way.","project management, design thinking, physical instruments, nonfunctional requirements, design constraints, software engineering"

However, we can provide such figures by analysing which of the 303 global Wikipedias (in about as many languages) have Shakespeare entries and how often these entries have been viewed. These statistics enable us to concretely identify which works are the most viewed in different contexts around the world. We will see, for instance, which cultures are more interested in Shakespeare’s tragedies, comedies, histories, and poetry. We will find out which single plays are preferred in different cultures, and which plays, instead, are practically ignored abroad. In short, we can distinguish different levels of popularity of his works in different settings. Thus, we will discover that for a plurality of Wikipedias, almost fifty, Romeo and Juliet is number one in pageviews, while in many, but fewer others, it is Hamlet. In seven Wikipedias, on the other hand, Macbeth is number one, while Julius Caesar is first in still several others. Othello, King Lear, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, As You Like It, and Antony and Cleopatra are the only other rare leaders in specific Wikipedias. In short, this article will present the basic popular global reception information about all of Shakespeare’s works, filling a lacuna in critical research; this will allow researchers to pursue more detailed levels of investigation of Shakespeare’s canonicity in different contexts across the globe.","global wikipedias, wikipedias, global popularity, william shakespeare, contemporary shakespeare reception, reliable figures"
"CONVERTING DEPENDENCY TREEBANK TO CONSTITUENCY TREEBANK FOR PERSIANThere are two major types of treebanks: dependency-based and constituency-based. Both of them have applications in natural language processing and computational linguistics. Several dependency treebanks have been developed for Persian. However, there is no available big size constituency treebank for this language. In this paper, we aim to propose an algorithm for automatic conversion of a dependency treebank to a constituency treebank for Persian. Our method is based on an existing method. However, we make modification to enhance its accuracy. The base algorithm constructs a constituency structure according to a set of conversion rules. Each rule maps a dependency relation to a constituency subtree. The constituency structure is built by combining these subtrees. We investigate the effects of the order in which dependency relations are processed on the output constituency structure. We show that the best order depends on the charactersitics of the target language. We also make modification in the algorithm for matching the conversion rules. To match a dependency relation to a conversion rule, we start with detailed infromation and if no match was found, we decrease the details and also change the method for matching. We also make modification in the algorithm used for combining the constituency subtrees. We use statistical data derived from a treebank to find a proper position for attaching a constituency subtree to the projection chain of the head. The expremental results show that these modifications provide an improvement of 16. 48% in the accuracy of the conversion algorithm.","conversion rules, constituency subtree, constituency treebank, dependency treebank, dependency relation, automatic conversion, natural language processing, computational linguistics"
"Fleshing Out the Bones: Studying the Human Remains Trade with Tensorflow and InceptionThere is an active trade in human remains facilitated by social media sites. In this paper we ask: can machine learning detect visual signals in photographs indicating that the human remains depicted are for sale? Do such signals even exist? This paper describes an experiment in using Tensorflow and the Google Inception-v3 model against a corpus of publicly available photographs collected from Instagram. Previous examination of the associated metadata for these photos detected patterns in the connectivity and rhetoric surrounding this ‘bone trade’, including several instances where ‘for sale’seemed to be implied, though not explicitly stated. The present study looks for signals in the visual rhetoric of the images as detected by the computer and how these signals may intersect with the other data present.","social media sites, active trade, human, bones, google inceptionv3 model, human remains, trade, visual signals"
"Metrics Dashboard: A Hosted Platform for Software Quality MetricsThere is an emerging consensus in the scientific software community that progress in scientific research is dependent on the"" quality and accessibility of software at all levels""(wssspe. researchcomputing. org. uk/). This progress depends on embracing the best traditional---and emergent---practices in software engineering, especially agile practices that intersect with the more formal tradition of software engineering. As a first step in our larger exploratory project to study in-process quality metrics for software development projects in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), we have developed the Metrics Dashboard, a platform for producing and observing metrics by mining open-source software repositories on GitHub. Unlike GitHub and similar systems that provide individual performance metrics (eg commits), the Metrics Dashboard focuses on metrics indicative of team progress and project health. The Metrics Dashboard allows the user to submit the URL of a hosted repository for batch analysis, whose results are then cached. Upon completion, the user can interactively study various metrics over time (at varying granularity), numerically and visually. The initial version of the system is up and running as a public cloud service (SaaS) and supports project size (KLOC), defect density, defect spoilage, and productivity. While our system is by no means the first to support software metrics, we believe it may be one of the first community-focused extensible resources that can be used by any hosted project.","metrics dashboard, scientific research, hosted platform, platform, software"
"Roman studies and digital resourcesThere is hardly any aspect of scholarly work and teaching in Roman Studies today not marked by digital technology. We assume that readers regularly access digital images of Roman material culture, use digitised corpora of primary sources in the original language or translation or consult online books and articles. The availability of digital resources on the internet is also a welcome enabler of ongoing public interest and even participation in the field. This overall state of affairs is generally a positive development, but both general trends and specific digital resources deserve a critical appraisal.","ongoing public interest, digital resourcesthere, original language, roman material culture, online books"
"New perspectives on reading and writing across the disciplinesThere’s a level of public anxiety that at times approaches moral panic around the argument that those born into a digital age have lost the ability as well as the desire to read or write long-form text. That anxiety haunts higher education, too. From rigorous research in the reading-heavy disciplines to conversations among colleagues after class, the internet is often held as responsible for the failure of too many of our students to be able to read enough disciplinary material in enough depth to allow them to take the next steps in the dialogic that constitutes a university education. We look to research that suggests that to blame changing technology is at best an oversimplification. While the capacity to deep read complex texts and to respond orally and in writing are foundational skills that are complicated by the rise of digital technologies, research on what has come to be termed reading non-compliance suggests the …","rigorous research, new perspectives, public anxiety, higher education, digital age, moral panic, longform text"

"Social Network-EpistemologyThis abstract describes how tools from network analysis and visualization can successfully support the study of philosophical questions in social epistemology. Social epistemology has become a hot topic not only in philosophy but also in popular culture. Since the Brexit referendum and the 2016 American presidential election, people have begun to worry about filter bubbles, echo chambers, and the amplification of polarization by social media 4,5. These are the sorts of phenomena that social epistemologists should be well-equipped to explain and evaluate. Most contemporary social epistemology presupposes a minimal network of just two nodes (speaker and hearer)1–3. To make sense of phenomena such as filter bubbles, polarization, and echo-chambers, though, we need to expand the universe of epistemic agents and enrich the relations among them. In other words, we can no longer abstract away from …","american presidential election, filter bubbles, popular culture, network analysis, social networkepistemologythis, hot topic, social epistemology, phenomena"
"Towards a Sustainable and Collaborative Data Model for Periodical StudiesThis article advocates the development of a sustainable, structured, and open data model for periodical research. Considering the recent digital turn in periodical studies, it argues that a data model embracing Linked Open Data practices will not only facilitate collaboration among periodical scholars across language boundaries but also contribute to a better understanding of what periodicals are and how the relationships among periodicals may evolve over time. By way of illustration, the article presents the data model developed in the context of an ongoing five-year research project on women editors and their periodicals in early-eighteenth- to early-twentieth-century Europe.","periodical studiesthis, open data model, data model, collaborative data model, ongoing fiveyear research project, periodical research, periodical scholars, periodicals"
"Thracians, Greeks or Romans? The inhabitants of ancient Thrace and their identity based on funerary inscriptionsThis article aims to present and discuss the identity of the inhabitants of Thrace, together with changing trends in the portrayal of social structure as preserved by epigraphic evidence. Apart from ethnic affiliations, I am also interested in the way people presented their public image and particularly which characteristics they valued enough to be publicly displayed for eternity. The available material is divided into two chronological groups in order to analyse the patterns of social behaviour in the pre-Roman and the Roman period respectively. I focus on selfidentification and identity as a part of the conscious presentation of some parts of the population of Thrace.So far, the study of epigraphic material focused on relevant descriptions of Thracian society as a whole has been limited in coverage. The epigraphic material was likely produced by the upper to middle classes for the most part, and as such does not represent the entire ancient social demographic. As a matter of fact, the evidence comes only from the epigraphically active facets of society (Bodel 2001, 16-35; Morris 1992, 158). This partial production of permanent epigraphic records may be due to limited levels of literacy among the population, and the relatively high cost of the production process. Nevertheless, the fact that epigraphic evidence represents the sociological values of a specific demographic group does not diminish its significance as a unique source of information presenting aspects of community identity from its own members. I approach the epigraphic as a direct source of information, representing the emic standpoint, also known as the internal or domestic (Pike 1954, 10 …","epigraphic material, social structure, epigraphic evidence, thrace, identity, greeks, ancient thrace, ethnic affiliations, thracians"
"Ars memorativa, abejas y miel en La CelestinaThis article analyzes La Celestina from the perspective of the art of memory. Due to the characterization of Celestina as a bee and the comparison of the lovers as flowers, it is possible to read the text in terms of an analogy that was widely used to describe intellective processes. This analogy compares the process to produce honey to the process that produces discourse. By masterly using language, Celestina manipulates the rest of the characters, but her lack of prudence will lead to her death. This article intends to broaden our understanding of the work by exploring one of the traditions it evokes.","intellective processes, perspective, celestina, la celestina, art, ars memorativa"
"Examining Web User Flows and Behaviours in CLARIN EcosystemThis article attempts to draw a map of the user flows and behaviours in the multi-layered CLARIN’s web structure by cross-examining the dynamic movements of different types of users within (and outside of) the CLARIN domain. In particular, the user traffic of several websites is analysed including the main website, various CLARIN web applications, and the partner websites, as well as the use of single sign-on. Consequently, this project is able to uncover the user interactions in the context of the large web ecosystem rather than those of an each individual website. The evolution of the web traffic over a year reveals a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of the end-users and provides a clue for the next strategic decisions over the CLARIN’s user-oriented services and business sustainability. This preliminary research also proves the potential of web analytics for Business Intelligence for measuring the impact of the aggregation services and research infrastructures in cultural heritage and digital humanities.","web user flows, dynamic movements, user, clarin ecosystemthis, services, partner websites, clarin domain, business, web structure"
"In Search of America: Topic modelling nineteenth-century newspaper archivesThis article considers how, and why, “Topic Modelling” tools can be used to analyse historical newspaper archives. While a growing number of media and communication studies projects have applied these techniques to corpuses of born-digital journalism, using the same tools to analyse large-scale collections of historical newspapers requires us to overcome additional technological and methodological challenges. Our discussion is framed around a historical case study examining references to the United States in the 19th Century British Library Newspaper Archive. The article begins by highlighting the problems that researchers of both digital and historical journalism face when attempting to deal with an enormous body of evidence. Next, it argues that Topic Modelling offers one potential solution to these problems by providing a way to “distant read” the archive.

"The conferral of value: the role of reporting processes in the assessment of cultureThis article considers the role of reporting processes in the assessment of arts and culture and argues that a determination of an organisation’s or event’s value is the result of a chain of administrative and political interactions. The ‘conferral of value’ on a particular cultural activity may be seen as the outcome of a multi-stakeholder dialogue involving governments, funding agencies, cultural organisations and individual artists. The article emerges from a mixed-methods research project, Laboratory Adelaide: The Value of Culture, underway at Flinders University. The project works with three industry partners: the State Library of South Australia, the State Theatre Company of South Australia and the Adelaide Festival. A sketch of the history of the problem of culture’s value is given, together with the historical background of the arts in South Australia.

"A multilingual gold standard for translation spotting of German compounds and their corresponding multiword units in English, French, Italian and SpanishThis article describes a new word alignment gold standard for German nominal compounds and their multiword translation equivalents in English, French, Italian, and Spanish. The gold standard contains alignments for each of the ten language pairs, resulting in a total of 8,229 bidirectional alignments. It covers 362 occurrences of 137 different German compounds randomly selected from the corpus of European Parliament plenary sessions, sampled according to the criteria of frequency and morphological complexity. The standard serves for the evaluation and optimisation of automatic word alignments in the context of spotting translations of German compounds. The study also shows that in this text genre, around 80% of German noun types are morphological compounds indicating potential multiword units in their parallel equivalents.","multiword units, german nominal compounds, automatic word alignments, multilingual gold standard, german compounds"
"Who Reads Science Fiction and Fantasy, and How Do They Feel About Science? Preliminary Findings From an Online SurveyThis article describes findings from an online survey Science Fiction & Fantasy: Your Experiences, launched in November 2015 and closed 1 year later, which received 909 unique responses. The survey identified characteristics of readers of science fiction, their knowledge and experiences of works, authors, and subgenres. It examined their attitudes to science and science fiction and their judgment of the similarity between real and fictional scientists. Contrary to declining reading habits, the science fiction and fantasy audience read consistently high volumes of books, as well as watching genre TV and film. We discovered that reading science fiction and fantasy may have a role in sustained, and cognitively beneficial, adoption of reading by young people and is complementary to other forms of consumption, rather than competitive. Science fiction was also found to be an important influence on the perception and …","online surveythis, fantasy audience, reading habits, science fiction, preliminary findings"
"GIS and graph models for social, temporal and spatial digital analysis in heritage: The case-study of ancient Kingdom of Seville Late Gothic productionThis article describes the development of a database management system (DBMS), to use as the basis for a dynamic spatial model or historical geographic information system (HGIS), and an abstract-relational model or dynamic graph model to allow historians and architects to visualise and analyse the complexity of built heritage on a territorial scale. Reutilisation, interoperability, standard terminology and usability were all taken into account in the development of the models. The database was developed within the framework of the International Late Gothic Network and involved an interdisciplinary team of architects, historians, geographers and computer scientists to ensure maximum adaptability of the methodology to other case studies. The result is a DBMS, a GIS model and a graph model, which we hope will provide useful tools for understanding, analysing and disseminating heritage.","historical geographic information system, database management system, late gothic, graph model, gis, standard terminology, spatial digital, ancient kingdom"
"The “Intimidating” ArchivesThis article discusses approaches I used to teach “Research Methods,” an archival-based course for a history graduate program at a small college. The instruction included baseline research strategies for students new to the humanities as well as advanced methodologies for experienced researchers, with attention given to archival research techniques. Most professional literature focuses on teaching archival literacy aimed at K–12 students or undergraduates; this article explores the distinct research and instruction needs of graduate students. It examines how graduate students perceive the research process, what difficulties they encounter while conducting research, and what impact attending the course could have on their long-term research procedures. While teaching the course, I discovered that students viewed archives as intimidating. By acknowledging that new users can feel daunted by researching archival collections, instructors and archivists can consider how to make the archives more welcoming to first-time visitors.Information seeking is a subjective process, one in which people approach with prior knowledge, strong opinions, and differing levels of cognitive development. Not all students arrive at graduate school with adequate research skills. Despite a long tradition of bibliographic instruction in academic libraries, students can earn bachelor’s degrees without taking information literacy workshops or even using the library much at all. As a result, when they continue their studies in graduate school, they may lack the skills needed to conduct the research required for master’s theses. They may also be deficient in information literacy …","graduate students, small college, baseline research strategies, history graduate program, information literacy, research methods"
"What Is Not in the Archive: Teaching Television History in the Digital Humanities EraThis article discusses the pedagogy and outcome of a new assignment we introduced in the course ‘Television History Online’at Utrecht University. We assigned the students the task to build a canon of a genre of Dutch television and create a video poster on the EUscreen portal consisting of clips that represent part of their canon. In our pedagogy, we argue that it is important to draw students’ attention to what is missing in the archive. Therefore, we offered the students the possibility to replace illegal clips with blue videos and clips of non-digital or lost television programmes with black videos in their video poster. We found evidence for an availability paradox: students let not only their selection of programmes and clips, but also the demarcation of their entire canon, be reliant on the digital, online availability of audiovisual material. At the same time, they explicitly did not want to be restricted by unavailability. In this article we stress the need for more open data and the importance of training digital literacy skills.","illegal clips, videos, television history, availability, video poster, digital, dutch television, new assignment"

"Connecting Medieval and Renaissance Manuscript CollectionsThis article examines issues affecting the reuse of data relating to collections of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts in libraries, museums and archives. These manuscripts are increasingly being made available in digital formats, although the extent is perhaps less than expected; a recent report on the situation in Germany estimated that only about 7.5% of the country’s 60,000 manuscripts had been digitized. Discovering these manuscripts is heavily dependent on the quality and consistency of descriptive data about them, but the current situation is very mixed and inconsistent, despite several national programmes (such as Manuscriptorium in the Czech Republic, e-codices in Switzerland, and Biblissima in France) and a major international effort by Europeana. This article reports on recent work in manuscript studies, drawing on two major international projects. The first, funded by the European Union between 2014 and 2016, focused on the manuscript collection assembled in the nineteenth century by Sir Thomas Phillipps. It investigated ways of reconstructing the history of this vast, but now-dispersed collection, by bringing together data from a range of digital and non-digital sources. The second project, Mapping Manuscript Migrations, funded by the Trans-Atlantic Platform under its Digging into Data Challenge from 2017 to 2019, extends the earlier work to a much larger scale, and implements a Linked Open Data framework for combining and managing data related to medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. It enables large-scale analysis and visualization of their history and movements over the centuries.","renaissance manuscripts, data, digital formats, medieval, major international effort, manuscript"
"Global Questions About Rent and the Longue Durée of Urban Power, 1848 to the PresentThis article examines the forces, public and private, that have exerted political power over the longue durée of the modern city since 1848. The article identifies three major turning points that contextualize the modern moment: the rise of democratic movements of 1848 and their gradual targeting of city governments; the rise of an expert-managed, urban reform state beginning in 1870; and the birth of neoliberal state, from 1974 to the present.

"Enchanted consumption and the gift (s) of diasporaThis article explores consumption practices in Paule Marshall’s Praisesong for the Widow (1983) and Helen Oyeyemi’s The Opposite House (2007), which it reads as a macroeconomic critique. This critique repositions “diaspora” as a concept with a distinctive lineage in modern and contemporary migration literary narratives that articulate alternative models of economic exchange through representations of food and eating. In my reading, diaspora is not only a sociological group orientation or a conceptual lens on the interiorized subjectivity arising from involuntary migration; it is also a set of alternative economic practices that confront global commodity culture through quotidian acts of consumption. Marshall and Oyeyemi both employ the literary device of “enchanted consumption” to contest the premise of consumer passivity found in traditional models of commodity fetishism.

"Colonizing Pepe: Internet Memes as CyberplacesThis article explores the Pepe the Frog Internet meme through a spatial approach that targets the ways in which netizens attempt to repurpose it, so as to build a communal space in which meaning is constantly negotiated and hijacked. We argue that Pepe the Frog and other memes can be interpreted as “cyberplaces” defined as computer environments that display the ideological polemics between netizens as they struggle to build a sense of community. Moreover, the rhizomatic stratification of such cyberplaces reveals a more nuanced view of meme dynamics, one that takes into account the agency of users as they efface and impose meanings on memes, not unlike the process of deterritorialization enacted on places.","frog internet meme, internet memes, pepe, communal space, frog, cyberplaces"
"Complaining about Lived Spaces: Responses to the Urban Living Environment of Northern Song KaifengThis article explores the understudied issue of urban problems in pre-modern China and examines the responses to the negative impact of urban development on life in the populous city of Kaifeng in the Northern Song (960–1127). Although writers, painters, and historians have portrayed the capital citys splendor for centuries, various urban problems emerged as medieval China became a more urbanized society. This article investigates Ouyang Xius (1007–1072) accounts of how extreme weather conditions adversely affected the lives of Kaifeng residents. These experiences, which he discussed in letters and poems, are associated with longer trends that result in climatic anomalies and disasters in the city. Ouyang Xiu also complained about living costs and medical services in Kaifeng. These reflect the difficulties in maintaining good urban provisions and services in a city of this scale.","urban development, lived spaces, northern song, premodern china, populous city, living"
"Timeline Drawing and the Online Scrapbook: Two Visual Elicitation Techniques for a Richer Exploration of Illness JourneysThis article explores the use of two visual methods to facilitate elicitation of temporal data in a qualitative interview study—specifically, a timeline drawing activity and collaborative viewing of an interface for visualizing personal social media histories, the Online Scrapbook—for eliciting participants’ recollections and reflections upon their experience of chronic illness. This study makes a novel contribution in the use of an interactive, data-driven timeline based on social media participation to elicit personal reflections. Both elicitation techniques were effective for encouraging participants to tell their story and take a closer look at their own experiences in their respective ways.

"Visualizing linguistic variation in a network of Latin documents and scribesThis article explores whether and how network visualization can benefit philological and historical-linguistic study. This is illustrated with a corpus-based investigation of scribes language use in a lemmatized and morphologically annotated corpus of documentary Latin (Late Latin Charter Treebank, LLCT2). We extract four continuous linguistic variables from LLCT2 and utilize a gradient colour palette in Gephi to visualize the variable values as node attributes in a trimodal network which consists of the documents, writers, and writing locations underlying the same corpus. We call this network the ""LLCT2 network"". The geographical coordinates of the location nodes form an approximate map, which allows for drawing geographical conclusions. The linguistic variables are examined both separately and as a sum variable, and the visualizations presented as static images and as interactive Sigma.js visualizations. The variables represent different domains of language competence of scribes who learnt written Latin practically as a second-language. The results show that the network visualization of linguistic features helps in observing patterns which support linguistic-philological argumentation and which risk passing unnoticed with traditional methods. However, the approach is subject to the same limitations as all visualization techniques: the human eye can only perceive a certain, relatively small amount of information at a time.","latin documents, language, network visualization, network, corpusbased investigation, linguistic variation"
"‘The Travelling Carriage in Old Times’: John Ruskin and the Lakes Tour in the Age of William IVThis article focuses on John Ruskins early writings about the English Lake District, and it considers the way these writings portray both his familys tours of the region and the conditions of Lakeland tourism in the age of William IV. Building on these considerations, the article then examines the relation of these tours to Ruskins advocacy of coach travel as a more morally and aesthetically sound mode of transportation than the railways. Ruskins thinking in these matters, the article contends, was informed by much more than sentimentalism. Rather, his thinking was guided by his association of coach travel with specific aesthetic and moral virtues: with the ability to perceive the beauty of natural forms and the freedom to cultivate that ability through the unhurried study and admiration of the natural world. In highlighting Ruskins promotion of these virtues, the article demonstrates how they contribute to an ethics of travel …","travelling carriage, early writings, john ruskin, lakeland tourism, lakes tour, coach travel, english lake district, william iv"
"Involving Stakeholders in Learning Analytics: Opportunity or Threat for Learning Analytics at Scale?This article introduces the goal and activities of the LAK 2018 half-day workshop on the involvement of stakeholders for achieving learning analytics at scale. The goal of the half-day workshop is to gather different stakeholders to discuss at-scale learning analytics interventions. In particular the workshop focuses on learning analytics applications and learning dashboards that go beyond the implementation in a single course or context, but that have at least the potential for scaling across different courses, programs, and institutes. The main theme of the workshop is to explore how the involvement of different stakeholders can strengthen or hinder learning analytics at scale.

"@ Preacher_Bot: an experiment in evangelical speech makingThis article is an experiment in digital methodology. It applies tools associated with the digital humanities to the study of Protestant evangelicalism in order to ask what digital research methods can offer the study of religion. Beginning with the development of a social media computer program called a Twitter bot designed to mimic evangelical ministers on twitter, the article considers how digital scholarship allows the work scholars produce to mirror more closely the religious worlds they study. Next, the article analyzes the results of the program using text analysis software. In documenting trends in the bots output, the article highlights how digital research methods can help answer long-standing questions in the field as well as potentially ask new ones. It concludes, The article, then, is both an exploration of contemporary religious cultures and a consideration of new media methods for analyzing them.","twitter bot, digital methodology, evangelical ministers, protestant evangelicalism, digital humanities, social media computer program, digital research methods"
"Future developments in cyber risk assessment for the internet of thingsThis article is focused on the economic impact assessment of Internet of Things (IoT) and its associated cyber risks vectors and vertices – a reinterpretation of IoT verticals. We adapt to IoT both the Cyber Value at Risk model, a well-established model for measuring the maximum possible loss over a given time period, and the MicroMort model, a widely used model for predicting uncertainty through units of mortality risk. The resulting new IoT MicroMort for calculating IoT risk is tested and validated with real data from the BullGuards IoT Scanner (over 310,000 scans) and the Garner report on IoT connected devices. Two calculations are developed, the current state of IoT cyber risk and the future forecasts of IoT cyber risk. Our work therefore advances the efforts of integrating cyber risk impact assessments and offer a better understanding of economic impact assessment for IoT cyber risk.","future developments, cyber risk, iot cyber risk, iot"
"Combining Close and Distant Reading: A Multiscalar Analysis of the English Lake Districts Historical SoundscapeThis article joins calls for literary scholarship to move beyond the limitations of binary oppositions between ‘close’ and ‘distant’ reading and towards the development of approaches that exploit the macroanalytic potential of digital methods alongside the nuanced analysis that characterises literary scholarship. Drawing on a customised corpus of writing about the English Lake District, we model the application of a multiscalar approach known as geographical text analysis (GTA), which combines aspects of close reading and distant reading, and, in doing so, introduces a new method for literary research. Here, we focus on historical descriptions of the Lake Districts soundscape to demonstrate both how perceptions of sound changed over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and how multi-scalar methods can uniquely uncover such historical-literary shifts. Sound, we argue, offers a particularly useful …","geographical text analysis, macroanalytic potential, literary scholarship, digital methods, multiscalar analysis, distant reading, customised corpus, binary oppositions, english lake district, multiscalar approach"
"Uncovering gender bias in newspaper coverage of Irish politicians using machine learningThis article presents a text-analytic approach to analysing media content for evidence of gender bias. Irish newspaper content is examined using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Systematic differences in the coverage of male and female politicians are uncovered, and these differences are analysed for evidence of gender bias. A corpus of newspaper coverage of politicians over a 15-year period was created. Features of the text were extracted and patterns differentiating coverage of male and female politicians were identified using machine learning. Discriminative features were then analysed for evidence of gender bias. Findings showed evidence of gender bias in how female politicians were portrayed, the policies they were associated with, and how they were evaluated.

"Scholastic Argumentation in Early English Medical Writing and Its Afterlife: New Corpus EvidenceThis article presents an exploratory data-driven corpus study in a long diachronic perspective on three specialized corpora of medical writing; this is the first time that the eighteenth century is included. Our research questions deal with the scholastic thought style in medical texts, its stylistic and generic features, and its afterlives. Our assumption is that these features continue in some form beyond their heyday. But this study has a methodological aim as well: it is of interest whether scholastic features can be detected by means of Document Classification and whether the method yields new insights and patterns that have gone unnoticed, as data-driven methods have the potential of revealing pertinent features. We combine statistical analysis with qualitative assessments and contextualize our results by discussing the sociohistorical and sociolinguistic backgrounds of texts and their authors and audiences, as best …","scholastic thought style, features, corpus, specialized corpora, new insights, medical texts, medical writing, scholastic argumentation"
"Modeling the Contested Relationship between Analects, Mencius, and Xunzi: Preliminary Evidence from a Machine-Learning ApproachThis article presents preliminary findings from a multi-year, multi-disciplinary text analysis project using an ancient and medieval Chinese corpus of over five million characters in works that date from the earliest received texts to the Song dynasty. It describes “distant reading” methods in the humanities and the authors’ corpus; introduces topic-modeling procedures; answers questions about the authors’ data; discusses complementary relationships between machine learning and human expertise; explains topics represented in Analects, Mencius, and Xunzi that set each of those texts apart from the other two; and explains topics that intersect all three texts. The authors’ results confirm many scholarly opinions derived from close-reading methods, suggest a reappraisal of Xunzi’s shared semantic content with Analects, and yield several actionable research questions for traditional scholarship. The aim of this article is …","multidisciplinary text analysis project, song dynasty, contested relationship, analects, preliminary evidence, medieval chinese corpus, xunzi, preliminary findings"
"Beyond the Archive: Bridging Data Creation and Reuse in ArchaeologyThis article presents research on archaeological data creation and management practices at two excavations in Europe in order to gain a better understanding of how to align these practices with the data reuse needs of a broader research community. The Secret Life of Data project follows the life cycle of data from the field to the digital repository to better understand opportunities and challenges in data interpretation, publication, and preservation. Our “Slow Data” approach focuses not on maximizing the speed and quantity of data but, rather, on emphasizing curation, contextualization, communication, and broader understanding. Through a mixed-methods approach of interviews, field observations, and excavation data assessments, we recommended changes (both technical and organizational) to improve data creation and management practices. We report our findings and offer readers guidance on streamlining …","broader research community, reuse, archaeological data creation, data, management practices, bridging data creation"
"Using innovative teaching practices to inspire critically engaged reading and writing in a neoliberal university environmentThis article presents the authors’ successful experiences with Cirrus, a purpose-built Digital Humanities teaching and learning platform developed at The University of Queensland between 2016 and 2018. Our case studies in teaching the crafts of close reading, critical analysis, and writing show that Cirrus’s annotation tools enable teachers to push students towards close critical engagements with the material they are studying – across textual, image, audio, and video formats – while the exhibition-building software allows for the transformation of the classic essay into a multi-faceted online presentation combining words, images, and other resources. However, we problematise our own involvement in the development of the platform by considering the ways such tools may become implicated in the negative impacts of neoliberalisation on the university sector in Australia and internationally. We are concerned that …","engaged reading, learning platform, innovative teaching practices, neoliberal university, annotation tools, writing show, purposebuilt digital humanities"
"The impact of thermal treatment on the mechanical properties of magnetic tapes: Tensile testThis article presents the method and the results of a test aimed to determine the tensile properties of magnetic tape samples before and after thermal treatment. The goal is to investigate whether thermal treatment has an effect on the tapes mechanical properties. A tape showing no symptoms of degradation has been used. No modifications have been observed, which is in line with the hypothesis that thermal treatment has no effect on ‘healthy’tapes. Thermal treatment is expected to restore the elasticity of damaged tapes, making them more resistant to mechanical stress and therefore less prone to break. This study contributes to the long-term goal of building a structured knowledge base about diagnostic tools and recovery methods for magnetic tapes.","mechanical properties, thermal treatment, magnetic tapes"
"The Impact of Therman Treatment on Magnetic Tapes: An Exploratory Study Combining Chemical Analyses and Audio FeaturesThis article presents the methodology and the first results of an exploratory study aimed to determine the modifications that thermal treatment induces on magnetic tapes and on the audio signal memorized on the tapes. In order to do so, a tape is tested before and after treatment: a set of chemical analyses are conducted on tape samples, and audio analyses on the corresponding digitized signals. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the treatment does not have negative effects on a healthy tape nor on the signal. Future work includes testing tapes showing signs of degradation. This study contributes to the long-term goal of building a structured knowledge base about diagnostic tools and recovery methods for magnetic tapes.","tape, magnetic tapes, chemical analyses, therman treatment, audio signal"
"A Formal Ontology for the Text Encoding InitiativeThis article presents the rationale and the proposal of a preliminary architecture of a formal ontology of the Text Encoding Initiative markup language. The reasons to have a formal and machine-readable semantics for TEI are manifold. In the first place, it would have a number of pragmatic and technical benefits, like better support for semantic interoperability in text encoding practices, easier cross-corpora query processing, seamless integration with Linked Open Data ecosystem. In second place, it would give a formalized account of the quasi-formal notion of the TEI abstract model, fostering the consistency and soundness of the TEI model. Given the complexity of the TEI encoding schema, such an ontology must necessarily have a very complex architecture, and its thorough definition will be a time consuming intellectual activity: in a first stage, we propose to limit its scope to a well-defined subdomain of the TEI, and to build it adopting pre-existing meta-ontology like EARMARK. The final part of the article gives some preliminary details of this design","encoding initiativethis, preliminary architecture, text encoding practices, linked open data ecosystem, formal ontology, easier crosscorpora query processing, machinereadable semantics"
"attributing authorship in the noisy Digitized correspondence of Jacob and Wilhelm grimmThis article presents the results of a multidisciplinary project aimed at better understanding the impact of different digitization strategies in computational text analysis. More specifically, it describes an effort to automatically discern the authorship of Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in a body of uncorrected correspondence processed by HTR (Handwritten Text Recognition) and OCR (Optical Character Recognition), reporting on the effect this noise has on the analyses necessary to computationally identify the different writing style of the two brothers. In summary, our findings show that OCR digitization serves as a reliable proxy for the more painstaking process of manual digitization, at least when it comes to authorship attribution. Our results suggest that attribution is viable even when using training and test sets from different digitization pipelines. With regard to HTR, this research demonstrates that even though automated transcription significantly increases risk of text misclassification when compared to OCR, a cleanliness above ≈ 20% is already sufficient to achieve a higher-than-chance probability of correct binary attribution.","handwritten text recognition, authorship, attribution, computational text analysis, noisy digitized correspondence, wilhelm grimm, uncorrected correspondence, digitization, multidisciplinary project"
"Virtual Cultural Experiences: the Drivers of SatisfactionThis article presents the results of an interdisciplinary research work on the emergence and impact of virtual technologies on the valorization of cultural experience. After reviewing the literature on immersive museography and the concepts of immersion, interaction and social interaction within a cultural experience, we focus our analysis on the drivers of the users’ satisfaction through a three-step research path. Firstly, we realized a preliminary qualitative overview of users’ reactions to virtual environments in a series of selected cultural experiences. Secondly, we designed a model focusing on immersion and social interaction as the two potentially critical drivers of satisfaction. Thirdly, we realized a quantitative study of a project concerning an intangible cultural asset. The results of this study give evidence to the link between immersion and emotion and emphasize the essential mediating role of social interaction. These conclusions are consistent with present technological and market trends, concerning the integration of virtual reality and social networks.","interaction, virtual cultural, threestep research path, immersive museography, critical drivers, cultural experience, social interaction"
"Prototyping Across the DisciplinesThis article pursues the idea that within interdisciplinary teams in which researchers might find themselves participating, there are very different notions of research outcomes, as well as languages in which they are expressed. We explore the notion of the software prototype within the discussion of making and building in digital humanities. The backdrop for our discussion is a collaboration between project team members from computer science and literature that resulted in a tool named TopoText that was built to geocode locations within an unstructured text and to perform some basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks about the context of those locations. In the interest of collaborating more effectively with increasingly larger and more multidisciplinary research communities, we move outward from that specific collaboration to explore one of the ways that such research is characterized in the domain of software engineering—the ISO/IEC 25010: 2011 standard. Although not a perfect fit with discourses of value in the humanities, it provides a possible starting point for forging shared vocabularies within the research collaboratory. In particular, we focus on a subset of characteristics outlined by the standard and attempt to translate them into terms generative of further discussion in the digital humanities community.","collaboration, project team members, research outcomes, geocode locations, digital humanities, software prototype, interdisciplinary teams"
"The perfect tense in manuscript of the 13th centuryThis article reflects the result of perfect form semantics study in the collection of words and teachings (RNL, Fp 1.39) of the 13th century, which was carried out within the framework of the project devoted to the evolution and the functioning of an ancient Russian verb. Most of the manuscript is occupied by Kirill Turovsky’s words. Besides, it contains the oldest South Russian translation of"" Tales of Aphroditian."" In this regard, the attention of researchers was mainly paid to the contents of the collection, and not to its linguistic and morphological characteristics. The work is the part of a comprehensive analysis of Tolstoys collection linguistic features. We have determined that in the source, as in many other works, the overwhelming number of perfect forms is represented by the 2nd and the 3rd person singular, but, unlike the"" traditional"" use of the 3rd person forms without a link, the collection has only few forms without a link. The formulation of a single meaning, which could explain all the contexts of the use and non-use of perfects, is impossible for us. Presumably, perfect conveys a certain complex of subjectively colored meanings, connected, on the one hand, with emotionally expressive isolation of an action or an event, and on the other hand-with an evidence or with a reference to a known information/source.","ancient russian verb, manuscript, oldest south russian translation, kirill turovsky, perfect tense, collection, 13th century"

"John Browns Description of the Lake at Keswick: New Clues and ClarificationsThis article reports on the discovery of hitherto undocumented printings of John Brown’s Description of the Lake at Keswick. Brown’s account of Keswick has long been recognised as a foundational document in the development of interest in the English Lake District during the eighteenth century. Such recognition notwithstanding, the history of Brown’s Description has not been fully documented and this lack of documentation has led to a number of mistaken assumptions about the text. The purpose of the present article is, therefore, not only to update the bibliographical record, but also to clarify a few inaccuracies in previous discussions of Brown’s account. In the process, the article explains how the early versions of Brown’s Description add a new dimension to the reception history of the text and, moreover, shift our understanding of the way the private circulation of unpublished print informed eighteenth-century appreciations of the Lakes region. The article includes an appendix, which presents a copy of the early printings of Brown’s text with a concise commentary.","john brown, english lake district, undocumented printings, new clues, foundational document, history, description, keswick, eighteenth century"
"Race, Writing, and Computation: Racial Difference and the US Novel, 1880-2000This article seeks to bridge two scholarly fields often seen as incommensurable: cultural analytics (also known as"" computational criticism"") and critical race studies. It does so by discovering generative points of contact between two sets of methods that are also typically viewed as antithetical: data science and critique. Cultural analytics is an emerging field wherein humanist scholars leverage the increasing availability of large digital corpora and the affordances of new computational tools. This allows them to study, for example, semantic and narratological patterns in the English-language novel at the scale of centuries and across tens-of-thousands of texts. Cultural analytics is a fast-growing field, with scholars taking on an expanding array of topics, including genre and cultural prestige. Yet there is one topic that remains relatively understudied: race and racial difference. The reasons for this elision are not hard to grasp. Computational methods demand the quantification of ones objects of study. Its likely easier to accept measuring a novels popularity by sales figures or classifying its genre by diction than labeling it according to discrete racial identifiers. Such labeling is an affront to critical race studies, which has taken as its very mission the deconstruction of racial categories.","computational, humanist scholars, generative points, racial difference, cultural analytics"
"Format Shift: Information Behavior and User Experience in the Academic E-book EnvironmentThis article seeks to understand information behavior in the context of the academic e-book user experience, shaped by a disparate set of vendor platforms licensed by libraries. These platforms vary in design and affordances, yet studies of e-book use in an academic context often treat e-books as a unified phenomenon in opposition to print books. Based on participant diaries tracking e-book information behavior and follow-up interviews and focus groups on troubleshooting and format shifting behaviors, this study seeks to provide a deep qualitative look at decisions that academic users make about formats when encountering e-books. It identifies reasons for noted disparities between stated user preferences for print books while often using e-books instead. It also demonstrates the importance of considering e-books as a set of formats, rather than a unified experience, when evaluating e-book platforms or providing information services around a set of platforms. While e-book studies often point to a distinction between “use” of e-books and “reading” of print books by users, this study shows much more willingness to both use and read e-books for some tasks if platforms allow for offloading reading of content to preferred reading devices and apps. This has implications for collection development, advocacy with vendors, and for marketing to or consulting with users about e-book access and use options.","disparate set, academic context, user experience, reading, information behavior, format shift, print books, vendor platforms"
"From Informatica Umanistica to Digital Humanities and return: a conceptual history of Italian DHThis article traces a history of the Italian tradition in DH, concentrating in particular in the so-called Roman school, whose intellectual and methodological legacy is, in my view, particularly relevant in this historical moment. Usual historiographical accounts of DH indicate in the figure of Father Busa the initiator of the field. However, the work of father Busa was not at all isolated in Italy. Since the 50s and 60s of the last century the Italian"" proto-DH"" landscape has been very lively. But it is especially in the 80s that, thanks to Tito Orlandi and his group, a new domain of scholarship called “Informatica Umanistica” emerges and consolidates. The peculiarity of this tradition resides in its mainly theoretical and methodological view of the intersection between computing and humanities. Hence the relevance given to the foundational issues of formalization, modeling and encoding and the thoughtful consideration of the …","usual historiographical accounts, historical moment, informatica umanistica, conceptual history, socalled roman school, digital humanities, methodological legacy, father busa, tradition"
"Multilayer Corpus StudiesThis book came into being as a result of about ten years of work on building and evaluating increasingly complex corpora. Doing this work alongside some of the most wonderful colleagues I’ve ever had gradually led to the realization that we often ended up with resources that were much more than the sum of their parts. This seemed especially true for many of the research questions discussed in this book, relating to issues in discourse representation: how entities are introduced and mentioned as a text develops, how referring expressions are realized as particular kinds of pronouns or lexical phrases, how they are ordered and linked to specific grammatical functions in context or how the functional discourse purpose of utterances affects the realization of words and phrases. In project after project, while we were analyzing the same texts again and again using different frameworks and tools, it became apparent that …","complex corpora, lexical phrases, discourse representation, corpus studiesthis, wonderful colleagues"

"Shakespeare and NasheThis book explores a number of questions about quotation that were inspired by Julia Kristeva’s definition of intertextuality, by Roland Barthes’ suggested move from ‘work’ to ‘text’ and by Michel Foucault’s reflections on ‘the modes of existence’ of discourse. Instead of asking ‘Who is the real author?’ or ‘Have we proof of his authenticity?’ (Foucault 138), I have looked at the following issues: What do quotations repeat? How do they modify what they repeat? How do texts draw attention to the fact that something is repeated? What is the effect of juxtaposing quotations from different sources? and What information do texts provide about what is repeated?","shakespeare, nashethis book, julia kristeva, michel foucault"

Once some preliminary matters of definition and description are taken care of, the discussion in this chapter proceeds largely along historical lines, presenting TRPGs as (1) originating in the early 1970s with the publication of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) and its early offshoots, imitators, and derivations and (2) developing in variety through the 1980s and 1990s as designers sought to emulate different fictional settings and genres and explore various gamemechanical approaches before (3) experiencing a period of “mainstream” consolidation and countervailing “indie” experimentation in the first years of the 21st century. It concludes with an attempt to discern the direction of future developments as the arrival of crowdfunding, print-ondemand (POD), and other Internet-enabled publishing tools change the face of the industry.","future developments, games, roleplaying gamesthis, roleplaying games, rpg, penandpaper"

The discussion of each theme draws on material from the volume and references wider scholarship. Reader discussion/reflection tasks are provided for each theme. The themes are as follows: Incorporating integrated skills teaching; providing practice; developing student fluency; building a collaborative learning environment; developing the strategic language user; providing effective assessment and feedback; and incorporating technology. The chapter concludes by linking these seven themes to the four overarching assumptions introduced in Chapter 1.","language teaching, themes, peer feedback, skills sections, affective advantage"

"Analog Girls in Digital Worlds: Dismantling Binaries for Digital Humanists Who Research Social MediaThis chapter is an exercise in creating the kind of scholarship we, the writers, Moya Bailey and Reina Gossett, wish existed. As Black queer and trans women, we want more research that addresses our lives at the intersections of race, gender, class, and sexuality. We find ourselves inside and outside the digital and academic spaces that shape our engagement with the world around us. To borrow from singer Erykah Badu, we are analog girls in digital worlds, meaning we retain qualities that do not quite fit with the places we navigate (Badu 2000). We see this chapter as an opportunity to bring these tensions into the light and begin to unpack multiple dichotomies. We are aware of few academic spaces where collaborators like us are understood as collaborators.

It also offers reflections on why the social living lab was a success, as well as the …","project, digital storytelling, lab initiative, digital participation, observational data, commercial applications, lab, living lab, community"
"The case for caseless prepositional constructions with voller in GermanThis chapter presents the case for a unification based, underspecification analysis of case assignment in some prepositional phrases in German, by focusing on the behavior of a family of unusual constructions informally expressed as X voller Y (‘X full of Y’). Specifically, I will be concerned with questions about the part-ofspeech category of voller (‘full of’) and the behavior of the grammatical case of its internal argument Y, as found in usage data. The extent to which this seemingly marginal word is interesting can be gleaned from the fact that there is no simple answer to these questions, neither empirically in corpus data nor introspectively by consulting speakers, including trained linguists. The basic problem is that, in contradiction to traditional generative Case Filter or Visibility Condition analyses (Chomsky 1981: 49, 1986: 94; see Bobaljik and Wurmbrand 2009 for a recent overview) which postulate a single case governed by a head to be linked to a semantic role, voller occurs with forms which, taken together, are not compatible with any one case analysis:(1) eine Badewanne voller (warmem) Wasser ‘a bathtub full of (warm) water’a bathtub full. of warm. dat water-dat?(2) eine Stadt voller (netter) Kinder ‘a city full of (nice) children’a city full. of nice. gen children. gen?","prepositional constructions, bathtub full, underspecification analysis"

"Local and Global Myths in Shakespearean PerformanceThis collection of scholarly essays offers a new understanding of local and global myths that have been constructed around Shakespeare in theatre, cinema, and television from the nineteenth century to the present. Drawing on a definition of myth as a powerful ideological narrative, Local and Global Myths in Shakespearean Performance examines historical, political, and cultural conditions of Shakespearean performances in Europe, Asia, and North and South America. The first part of this volume offers a theoretical introduction to Shakespeare as myth from a twenty-first century perspective. The second part critically evaluates myths of linguistic transcendence, authenticity, and universality within broader European, neo-liberal, and post-colonial contexts. The study of local identities and global icons in the third part uncovers dynamic relationships between regional, national, and transnational myths of Shakespeare. The fourth part revises persistent narratives concerning a political potential of Shakespeare’s plays in communist and post-communist countries. Finally, part five explores the influence of commercial and popular culture on Shakespeare myths. Michael Dobson’s Afterword concludes the volume by locating Shakespeare within classical mythology and contemporary concerns.","global myths, powerful ideological narrative, nineteenth century, new understanding, shakespearean performancethis, scholarly essays, shakespearean performance"

Those occur at different levels of social life, mutually influence each other, and are especially visible at the terminal that both normalizes and accelerates them. Synthesizing the material reviewed in this book, the chapter then discusses three interrelated risks these mutations present to the terminal self, and suggests strategies to resist them or counteract their effects. At the intrapersonal level, those mutations degrade the terminal self’s embodied engagement with reality, orientations to others, perceptions, information-management, experience of autonomy, privacy, agency, subjectivity, and the ability to sustain a mode of attention that overrides the terminal one. At the interpersonal level, those mutations deteriorate the terminal self’s interactional aptitudes and …","prospects, anthropological mutations, hypermodern society, social life, information civilizationthis, capitalism"
"The role of the metonymy and metaphor in the conceptualization of NATION. An emergent ontological analysis of syntactic-semantic constructions.This corpus-based study presents an emergent ontological analysis of syntactic-semantic constructions of the concept NATION. Using large Croatian corpora, I analyzed the ontological congruency of the collocations of the lexeme nacija ‘nation’ in five types of syntactic-semantic constructions. This approach enabled the formal hierarchical description of the metaphoric conceptualization of NATION and the cognitive mechanism of eliciting reification, personification and social appraisal of NATION. Metaphoric mapping is seen as a powerful instrument for conceptualizing the institutional status of NATION, reinforcing the interaction between MEMBERS, and the creation of collective IDENTITY that influences a PERSON’S self-appraisal, and vice versa.","syntacticsemantic constructions, metaphoric mapping, formal hierarchical description"
"Chinese 101B: Introduction to Classical Chinese II (Winter 2019)This course introduces students to the grammar and vocabulary of Classical Chinese. Readings cover a range of texts and genres from the early and medieval periods, with a few examples from later periods.

"IMLS National Forum on Data Mining Research Using In-copyright and Limited-access Text Datasets: Discussion Paper, Forum Statements, and SWOT analysesThis discussion paper foregrounds discussion at “Text Mining with Limited-Access Data,” a National Forum funded by the Institute for Museum and Library Services. The forum convened twenty-five stakeholders for a day-and-a-half long meeting to explore the current landscape for text data mining using texts that are under copyright or protected by licenses, including terms of use licenses, that limit access and use. The stakeholders include librarians, researchers, legal experts, content providers, and representatives of professional organizations. Prior to the forum, project team members interviewed stakeholders to learn more about their perspectives on research that employs use-limited text data, and to guide forum participants in drafting written statements and SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat) analyses. This paper reports on the progress of the National Forum project, as well as synthesizes participant responses to the interviews and in their forum statements. It intends to establish a shared vocabulary and key points of consideration for the forum. Initial forum statements and SWOT analyses are included as a separate document.","text data, text mining, discussion, data mining, national forum, limitedaccess data, forum statements"
"Outside the canon: theatre, social change, and archival memoryThis dissertation examines the intersection of theatre and society of post-Emergency Ireland through a methodological assessment of social, performative and archival memory. It identifies a group of new Irish plays and practitioners of the period which have been neglected within Irish theatre historiography and foregrounds their importance to the critical understanding of modern Irish theatre in performance and production. These works challenged the boundaries and authorities of both traditional Irish society and also theatre production. Key figures addressed include John Murphy, Carolyn Swift, J.P. Donleavy, Phyllis Ryan, Mary Manning, Edna O’Brien and Hugh Leonard.

"Connectionism and post-connectionist modelsThis entry covers the past and present development of connectionism in three sections:“Roots”,“Revolution”, and “Radiation”. Roots summarizes the first efforts to assemble neuron-like elements into network models of cognitive function. It includes McCulloch and Pitts’ demonstration that their nets can compute any logical function, Rosenblatt’s perceptrons, and Hebb’s learning rule. The section ends with Minsky and Papert’s famous complaint that perceptrons and other simple architectures cannot calculate certain Boolean functions. This sets the stage for a discussion of implementational vs radical interpretations of connectionist modeling. The second section describes the innovations that led to the PDP revolution of the 1980s, including sigmoidal and other activation functions, backpropagation, multi-level nets, and the introduction of simple recurrence.

"Like Mother like Daughter, like Father like Son: The Spell of Youth on “The OC”This essay aims to shed light on the purposes served by parental figures in the television series The OC (2003-2007). For the teen-drama genre, Josh Schwartz’s creation set a new trend of intergenerational narratives and shifted the perspectives among young and adult, and female and male characters. In addition to being functional to the plot and legitimizing the problems experienced by young viewers, parental figures serve at least two additional purposes on The OC. First, I posit that adults act as positive and negative role models that allow Schwartz’s show to function as a cautionary tale for its young viewers. Second, I propose that subplots revolving around parents allowed the showrunner to broaden the potential audience of the series, by targeting adults in addition to teen viewers. I finally suggest that, as most of the show’s characters–parents and children alike-engage in youthful behavior, the series also seems to promote and perpetuate what sociologist Marcel Danesi has defined the “Forever Young Syndrome”–a kind of society where the generational gap is almost nonexistent and adults systematically behave, and inevitably consume, like teenagers.","male characters, intergenerational narratives, new trend, parental figures, josh schwartz, television series, teendrama genre"

"What Is History of Psychology? Network Analysis of Journal Citation Reports, 2009-2015This essay considers the History of Psychology—its interests and boundaries—using the data behind the Journal Impact Factor system. Advice is provided regarding what journals to follow, which broad frames to consider in presenting research findings, and where to publish the resulting studies to reach different audiences. The essay itself has also been written for those with only passing familiarity with its methods. It is therefore not necessary to be an expert in network analysis to engage in “virtual witnessing” while considering methods or results: Everything is clearly explained and carefully illustrated. The further consequence is that those who are new to the History of Psychology as a specialty, distinct from its subject matter, are introduced to the myriad historical perspectives within and related to psychology from the broadest possible perspective. A supplemental set of exemplary readings is also provided, in …","journal citation, virtual witnessing, myriad historical perspectives, research findings, methods, network analysis, history, psychology"
"Is Falstaff Falstaff? Is Prince Hal Henry V?: Topic Modeling Shakespeare’s PlaysThis essay demonstrates how topic modeling can be fruitfully applied to TEI-encoded plays, which allows scholars to analyze speeches by individual characters. Our analysis centers on Shakespeare’s corpus and characters who reappear in multiple plays. Specifically, we use topic models to show that young Prince Hal (in 1 and 2 Henry IV) does not speak the same language as his later self, Henry V (in his titular play): his linguistic shift mirrors his shift in status. Hal himself announces,“I have turned away my former self”—his change in diction bears out his assertion. Conversely, topic models reveal that Falstaff is Falstaff across multiple plays and genres (notably, 1 and 2 Henry IV and The Merry Wives of Windsor), despite scholarly claims to that the Falstaff of comedy is a watered-down version of the braggart drunk of the history plays. Ultimately, we hope that this algorithmically-informed analysis of Shakespeare’s plays is not taken as a final answer, but, instead, as a prompt. As this research reveals, topic modeling plays with attention to each speaker opens the door for new comparisons, and in turn, expands on previous interpretations of literature.","playsthis essay, teiencoded plays, falstaff, topic modeling, falstaff falstaff, individual characters, analysis, multiple plays, henry iv, prince hal"
"A 1562 Petrarchan Italian-English Dictionary Inscribed by"" Maria sidney"".This essay discusses an annotated copy of William Thomass bilingual grammar-dictionary Principal Rules of the Italian Grammer (1562), which appears to have belonged to the Sidney family during the sixteenth century. The vellum binding does not predate 1604, but an inscription in secretary hand in the books pages connects this language-learning volume to a"" lady Sidnay,"" probably Mary Dudley Sidney. Additionally, an italic hand on a blank leaf has written out an Italian terzina from Petrarchs"" Trionfo della Morte,"" undersigned with the name"" Maria sidney."" If the latter inscription is the work of Mary Sidney Herbert, the Countess of Pembroke, it offers a firsthand view into her youthful readings of the very Petrarch verses she would translate into English.

"Brooms of Doom: Notes on Domestic Bodies Gendered to Death in Mughal-e-Azam, Fire, and EarthThis essay explores how current trends of xenophobic and class-based violence target women of color in a throwback to postcolonial studies. Representational discourses produce these subjects as gendered bodies whose ultimate difference lies in a postcolonial biology of difference that opens them to death. In particular, I unravel the tight braid of domesticity “at home” with the necropolitical prerogative of patriarchal hegemons in three key Hindi films: K. Asif’s Mughal-e-Azam and Deepa Mehta’s Fire and Earth. I begin by recalling various theories of representation of women of color in relation to the othering of gendered and racialized bodies, and then link them to regimes of gender that are allegorized by the “brooms” of domesticity. I focus on the women protagonists, and demonstrate that these three films, with respect to their varying historical periods, deposit gendered domesticity as the occasion and …","representational discourses, notes, key hindi films, earththis essay, classbased violence target women, doom, postcolonial, domestic bodies gendered, brooms"
"Bundling, reprinting, and reframing: Serial practices across bordersThis essay explores the circulation of periodical material between metropolitan and regional locations in early twentieth-century North America. It asks how the globalized consumer technology of the household magazine was being taken up outside of cosmopolitan centers through the framework of local, regional, or national concerns. For example, mainstream Canadian monthlies such as The Western Home Monthly and Maclean’s frequently engaged with, or re-used, content and formats taken from New York publications. To understand these transnational publishing dynamics, we argue, it is crucial to attend to the material practices of magazines. The essay analyzes several such practices, including both editorial and sales strategies. We look at the reprinting or reframing of complete features and of excerpts from other periodicals. We examine the simultaneous serialization of novels in American and Canadian publications, using a case study of Martha Ostensos Wild Geese. And we offer the first critical discussion of bundling, whereby US and Canadian titles were packaged together as a single subscription. The essay argues that the affordances of seriality, particularly timeliness and increased circulation through decreasing prices, allowed editors to redeploy metropolitan print materials for a regional readership eager to imagine themselves as participants in the new project of modernity.","globalized consumer technology, canadian, household magazine, cosmopolitan centers, essay, regional locations, serial practices, early twentiethcentury north america, bordersthis essay, new york publications, periodical material"

"Machines and Humans, Schemes and TropesThis is a study of rhetorical schemes in the drama of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, using computer-assisted methods that we devised to gather 112 instances of gradatio in a corpus of 400 texts from 1566 to 1647. But it is also a meta-analysis of those methods, addressing how quantifications of qualitative text features paradoxically reduce complex language structures to expand our grasp of them. Gradatio seems like a straightforward structure: consider Philip Sidneys"" Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,/Knowledge might pity win…"". But we found variations on this scheme to be more prevalent than conventional usage. Ultimately this reaffirms an essential feature of literary style, which constitutes departures from conventional language.","rhetorical schemes, complex language structures, qualitative text features, humans"

"We need to talk about the digital humanities jobThis is not a commentary on the definition, legitimacy, or future of digital humanities (DH) – there is already enough of that around. Rather, it is a treatment of one of the field’s most significant yet elided aspects – jobs. Not just any job, not the tenure-track professorship wherein digital humanities is combined with an established discipline like literary studies or history; this is an exploration of ‘the DH job’. I refer to positions largely considered to be ‘alt-ac’ designed to support the development of DH within a particular institution. This is both a matter of pragmatics and ethics: the extent to which such roles align with existing frameworks needs to be fully appreciated if they are to benefit higher education, and we shouldn’t be putting people in these positions until we’ve answered such questions.","digital humanities, legitimacy, definition, commentary, tenuretrack professorship"

"Leveraging Concepts in Open Access PublicationsThis paper addresses the integration of a Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation (NERD) service within a group of open access (OA) publishing digital platforms and considers its potential impact on both research and scholarly publishing. The software powering this service, called entity-fishing, was initially developed by Inria in the context of the EU FP7 project CENDARI and provides automatic entity recognition and disambiguation using the Wikipedia and Wikidata data sets. The application is distributed with an open-source licence, and it has been deployed as a web service in DARIAHs infrastructure hosted by the French HumaNum. In the paper, we focus on the specific issues related to its integration on five OA platforms specialized in the publication of scholarly monographs in the social sciences and humanities (SSH), as part of the work carried out within the EU H2020 project HIRMEOS (High Integration of Research Monographs in the European Open Science infrastructure). In the first section, we give a brief overview of the current status and evolution of OA publications, considering specifically the challenges that OA monographs are encountering. In the second part, we show how the HIRMEOS project aims to face these challenges by optimizing five OA digital platforms for the publication of monographs from the SSH and ensuring their interoperability. In sections three and four we give a comprehensive description of the entity-fishing service, focusing on its concrete applications in real use cases together with some further possible ideas on how to exploit the annotations generated.

"Health and Traditional Fishing in All Saints Bay, BrazilThis paper aims to identify the chronic non-transmittable diseases afflicting individuals involved in the traditional fishing system of All Saints Bay (state of Bahia) and the search for treatment for these diseases. Based on research carried out among the fishing communities of three municipalities of All Saints Bay, the paper analyses data collected by means of a small survey (N= 127). Fifty-six percent of the respondents suffer from two or even three chronic diseases, which they consider serious. The majority finds that work in fishing and harvesting shellfish, and a lack of medical assistance, are the main causes of their poor health. When asked about treatment the main complaint raised by respondents concerns the poor conditions in which health care units function and the difficulties involved in travel to health care facilities located outside their communities. It is important to note that the health conditions of these traditional fishing communities are likely to further deteriorate due to governmental budget cuts and measures taken by the government to regulate traditional fishing activities.","fishing communities, health care, saints bay, chronic nontransmittable diseases, respondents, traditional fishing, traditional fishing system"
"Open learner models and learning analytics dashboards: a systematic reviewThis paper aims to link student facing Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) to the corpus of research on Open Learner Models (OLMs), as both have similar goals. We conducted a systematic review of literature on OLMs and compared the results with a previously conducted review of LADs for learners in terms of (i) data use and modelling,(ii) key publication venues,(iii) authors and articles,(iv) key themes, and (v) system evaluation. We highlight the similarities and differences between the research on LADs and OLMs. Our key contribution is a bridge between these two areas as a foundation for building upon the strengths of each. We report the following key results from the review: in reports of new OLMs, almost 60% are based on a single type of data; 33% use behavioral metrics; 39% support input from the user; 37% have complex models; and just 6% involve multiple applications.

"Developing the ontological model for research and representation of Commemoration Speeches in Croatia using a graph property databaseThis paper demonstrates the ontological model of commemoration speeches given in Croatia that was developed as a part of the project ""Framing the Nation and Collective Identity in Croatia: Political Rituals and the Cultural Memory of Twentieth Century Traumas"". The research gathers linguistic, media and social data about seven commemoration practices connected to the wars of the 20th century using various methodologies involving audio-visual field recordings, transcription of commemoration speeches and the creation of a text corpus. This chapter presents digital humanities methods used to connect various levels of data analysis and digital resources, from natural language processing (NLP) of Croatian to conceptual enrichment through the processing of conceptual metaphors. These resources are integrated using the Neo4j database and the Python Py2Neo library for data manipulation of the ontological model that embeds the linguistic and media research in the context respectively of the social identity of actors, their interaction, institutional affiliations and cultural models they represent and express. The value of this ontological model is in fostering an interdisciplinary approach through the contextualization of data and targeted usage of digital resources.","research, political rituals, twentieth century traumas, collective identity, digital humanities methods, commemoration speeches, ontological model, social data, media, graph property, croatia, digital resources"

The system uses skip-gram word embeddings with negative sampling, trained on specialised corpora. Candidate hypernyms for an input word are predicted based on cosine similarity scores. Two sets of word embedding models were trained separately on two specialised corpora: a medical corpus and a music industry corpus. Our system scored highest in the medical domain among the competing unsupervised systems but performed poorly on the music industry domain. Our approach does not depend on any external data other than raw specialised corpora.","specialised corpora, skipgram word embeddings, unsupervised hypernym discovery, word embedding models, adapt, semeval2018 task"
"Annotating a Low-Resource Language with LLOD Technology: Sumerian Morphology and SyntaxThis paper describes work on the morphological and syntactic annotation of Sumerian cuneiform as a model for low resource languages in general. Cuneiform texts are invaluable sources for the study of history, languages, economy, and cultures of Ancient Mesopotamia and its surrounding regions. Assyriology, the discipline dedicated to their study, has vast research potential, but lacks the modern means for computational processing and analysis. Our project, Machine Translation and Automated Analysis of Cuneiform Languages, aims to fill this gap by bringing together corpus data, lexical data, linguistic annotations and object metadata. The project’s main goal is to build a pipeline for machine translation and annotation of Sumerian Ur III administrative texts. The rich and structured data is then to be made accessible in the form of (Linguistic) Linked Open Data (LLOD), which should open them to a larger research community. Our contribution is two-fold: in terms of language technology, our work represents the first attempt to develop an integrative infrastructure for the annotation of morphology and syntax on the basis of RDF technologies and LLOD resources. With respect to Assyriology, we work towards producing the first syntactically annotated corpus of Sumerian.

"Store, interface, package, connectionThis paper discusses methodological approaches to app studies, focussing on their embeddedness and situatedness within multiple infrastructural settings. Our approach arises by paying close attention to the multivalent affordances of apps as software packages, particularly their capacity to enter into diverse groupings and relations depending on different infrastructural situations. The changing situations they evoke and participate in, accordingly, makes apps visible and accountable in a variety of unique ways. Engaging with and even staging these situations, therefore, allows for political-economic, social and cultural dynamics associated with apps and their infrastructures can be investigated through a style of research we describe as multi-situated app studies. The piece offers an overview of four different entry points of enquiry that are exemplary of this overarching framework, focussing on app stores, app interfaces, app packages and app connections. We conclude with nine propositions that develop out of these studies as prompts for further research.","close attention, apps, multivalent affordances, packages, multiple infrastructural settings, store, methodological approaches"

During the media storm that followed the publication of the video, many hinted at a “magic event,” which could be related to popular perceptions of Ancient Egypt: ideas from movies and popular culture were widely used to explain and comment, often ironically, on the episode. At the same time, in the museum galleries people were jostling to see the statuette and questioning the museum staff.

We have found that the general effect is positive but not uniform across different types of journals. In particular, we investigate two types of heterogeneous treatment effect: (1) the differential treatment effect among journals grouped by academic field, publisher, and tier; and (2) differential treatment effects of Open Access as a function of propensity to be treated. The results are robust to a number of sensitivity checks and falsification tests. Our findings shed new light on Open Access effect on journals and can help stakeholders of journals in the decision of adopting the Open Access policy.","open access, treatment, access increase journal citescores, empirical investigation"
"Measuring Joycean Influences on Flann O’BrienThis paper examines the stylometric similarities between James Joyce and Flann O’Brien, demonstrating which works from the latter’s oeuvre are stylistically the most Joycean. We will outline the results of a series of quantitative enquiries focused specifically on Joyce and O’Brien, before offering a number of literary interpretations. It has long been argued that Brian O’Nolan, operating under the pseudonym of Flann O’Brien, is a disciple of James Joyce. This relationship remains a concern for scholars, and so our purpose here is to contribute some computational evidence to the discussion. We pinpoint those exact moments where O’Brien’s style is quantitatively similar to that of Joyce, using our results to re-engage existing arguments with renewed statistical precision.","quantitative enquiries, flann, joycean influences, james joyce, stylometric similarities"

"Icelandic Scribes: Results of a 2-Year ProjectThis paper introduces an online catalogue of an early modern library: the main digital output of the author’s individual research project “Icelandic Scribes”(2016–2018 at the University of Copenhagen). The project has investigated the patronage of manuscripts by Icelander Magnús Jónsson í Vigur (1637–1702), his network of scribes and their working practices, and the significance of the library of handwritten books that he accumulated during his lifetime, in the region of Iceland called the Westfjords. The online catalogue is meant to be a digital resource that reunites this library virtually, gives detailed descriptions of the manuscripts, and highlights the collection’s rich store of texts and the individuals behind their creation. The present paper also explores some of the challenges of integrating new data produced by this and other small projects like it with existing online resources in the field of Old Norse-Icelandic studies. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 654825.","project, individual research project, early modern library, library, icelandic scribes, online catalogue, digital, icelander magnús jónsson"

"Areal sound change and the distributional typology of affricate richness in EurasiaThis paper makes a contribution to phonological typology by investigating the distribution of affricate-rich languages in Eurasia. It shows that affricate-rich and affricate-dense languages cluster areally within Eurasia, and have area-specific histories. In particular, the affricate-rich areas of western Eurasia—a ‘European’area and a Caucasian area—are not the result of contact-induced sound changes or borrowing, while the two affricate-rich areas of eastern Eurasia—the Hindukush area and the eastern Himalayan area—are the result of contact. Specifically, affricate-rich areas depend on the emergence of retroflex affricates. Moreover, languages outside these affricate-rich areas tend to lose retroflex affricates.","affricate richness, phonological typology, affricatedense languages cluster, affricaterich areas, affricaterich languages, distributional typology, western eurasia"

"Spatial predictive modeling of prehistoric sites in the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands based on graph similarity analysisThis paper presented a new method for identifying promising areas for archaeological research. The method is based on graph analysis that iteratively compares and manipulates Hamming distances between graphs of input geographical parameters and graphs of human activity data in various historical periods. The weights learned from the comparison was used to build a prediction model to estimate the potential presence of an archaeological site of a certain time period in a given cadaster. This was applied in the Bohemian Moravian Highlands region based on the most complete archaeological dataset of the area. Resulting maps were analyzed from the archaeological and historical point of view to test against the existing knowledge of prehistoric population movement in the region. Overall, the method proved to overcome problems such as fragmentary inputs and is a good candidate for application in smaller …","method, graph similarity, promising areas, spatial predictive modeling, prehistoric sites, archaeological site, archaeological research, new method, bohemianmoravian highlands, input geographical parameters"

"VisGuides: A forum for discussing visualization guidelinesThis paper presents VisGuides, a discussion platform to facilitate the collection, evaluation, critique, revision, and dissemination of visualization guidelines. As visualization becomes a more widespread discipline with much more attention by designers and the general public, we need to ensure mechanisms for communicating, transferring, and accessing visualization knowledge. A visualization guideline can be anything ranging from good practices, empirical studies, and survey reports with the goal to inform visualization design and understanding. Thus, our forum aims (i) to collect visualization guidelines,(ii) to discuss guidelines and collect respective empirical references, and in the long run,(iii) to establish formal knowledge about guidelines by analyzing the forum content and the consensus of discussions.

"Literary Exploration Machine A Web-Based Application for Textual ScholarsThis paper presents a design of a web-based application for textual scholars. The goal of this project is to create a complex and stable research environment allowing scholars to upload the texts they analyse and either explore them with a suite of dedicated tools or transform them into a different format (eg text, table, list, spreadsheet). The latter functionality is especially important for research focusing on Polish texts (due to the rich morphology and weakly constrained word order of Polish) because it allows for their further processing with tools built for English. This project utilises the existing CLARIN-PL applications and supplements them with new functionalities.","textual scholars, dedicated tools, webbased application, scholars, stable research environment"
"A Characterwise Windowed Approach to Hebrew Morphological SegmentationThis paper presents a novel approach to the segmentation of orthographic word forms in contemporary Hebrew, focusing purely on splitting without carrying out morphological analysis or disambiguation. Casting the analysis task as character-wise binary classification and using adjacent character and word-based lexicon-lookup features, this approach achieves over 98% accuracy on the benchmark SPMRL shared task data for Hebrew, and 97% accuracy on a new out of domain Wikipedia dataset, an improvement of~ 4% and 5% over previous state of the art performance.","morphological analysis, hebrew morphological segmentationthis, contemporary hebrew, task data, analysis task, characterwise windowed approach"
"Data in the smart city: How incongruent frames challenge the transition from ideal to practiceThis paper presents an analysis of interviews, focus groups and workshops with employees in the technical administration in the municipality of Copenhagen in the year after it won a prestigious Smart City award. The administration is interpreted as a ‘most likely’ to succeed in translating the idealised version of the smart city into a workable bureaucratic practice. Drawing on the work of Orlikowski and Gash, the empirical analysis identifies and describes two incongruent ‘technological frames’ that illustrates different ways of making sense of data and the smart city within this single organisational unit. One is called the experimentalist’s credo and it is characterised by inspiration from the development of an Internet of Things as well as a readiness to learn from the open source community in software development. The other is called the data-owners vocation and it is characterised by a more situated approach that …","development, data, technical administration, smart city, incongruent frames, transition"
"A qualitative evaluation of a learning dashboard to support advisor-student dialoguesThis paper presents an evaluation of a learning dashboard that supports the dialogue between a student and a study advisor. The dashboard was designed, developed, and evaluated in collaboration with study advisers. To ensure scalability to other contexts, the dashboard uses data that is commonly available at any higher education institute. It visualizes the grades of the student, an overview of the progress through the year, his/her position in comparison with peers, sliders to plan the next years and a prediction of the length of the bachelor program for this student in years based on historic data. The dashboard was deployed at KU Leuven, Belgium and used in September 2017 to support 224 sessions between students and study advisers. We observed twenty of these conversations.

"Enabling adaptability in web forms based on user characteristics detection through A/B testing and machine learningThis paper presents an original study with the aim of improving users’ performance in completing large questionnaires through adaptability in web forms. Such adaptability is based on the application of machine learning procedures and an A/B testing approach. To detect the user preferences, behavior, and the optimal version of the forms for all kinds of users, researchers built predictive models using machinelearning algorithms (trained with data from more than 3000 users who participated previously in the questionnaires), extracting the most relevant factors that describe the models and clustering the users based on their similar characteristics and these factors. Based on these groups and their performance in the system, the researchers generated heuristic rules between the different versions of the web forms to guide users to the most adequate version (modifying the user interface and user experience) for them …","performance, user characteristics,  machine learning, user preferences, questionnaires"
"Proposing a Machine Learning Approach to Analyze and Predict Employment and its Factors.This paper presents an original study with the aim of propose and test a machine learning approach to research about employability and employment. To understand how the graduates get employed, researchers propose to build predictive models using machine learning algorithms, extracting after that the most relevant factors that describe the model and employing further analysis techniques like clustering to get deeper insights. To test the proposal, is presented a case study that involves data from the Spanish Observatory for Employability and Employment (OEEU). Using data from this project (information about 3000 students), has been built predictive models that define how these students get a job after finalizing their degrees. The results obtained in this case study are very promising, and encourage authors to refine the process and validate it in further research."," machine learning, predict employment, machine learning approach"

"Semantic alignment in museums, archives and libraries. The ontologies for describing relationshipsThis paper presents the state of the art of the cataloguing description of personal relationships between creators of archival records and people that are related to the life cycle of cultural objects, as highlighted by museums, archives and libraries records (ie GLAM, translated in italian MAB). Since people are fundamental access points to the cultural heritage, the representation of relationships between people and corporate bodies in Linked Open Data is of increasing interest. Nonetheless, a shared and comprehensive vocabulary of personal relationships is not available yet. Leveraging on Semantic Web technologies, and ontologies in particular, the aim is to identify existing ontologies that allow to represent relationships in their context (ie time, space and events); to map and classify different types of personal relationships; and to provide a formal representation of relationships not available in existing ontologies. As a result, we present an ontology, with a controlled vocabulary, for the representation of the scenario of personal relationships in the cultural heritage domain.","semantic alignment, people, records, representation, cultural objects, personal relationships, life cycle, cultural heritage, italian mab, museums, ontologies, fundamental access points"
"Machine-aided close listening: Prosthetic synaesthesia and the 3D phonotext.This paper proposes a new listening methodology that lies, in some sense, between Charles Bernsteins close listening and Tanya Clements distant listening. While its tempting to think of these approaches as presenting an integral of scope, Bernsteins work proposes the use and tuning of the human ear for understanding the sonic materiality of the phonotext, while Clements work, following its namesake of Morettis distant reading, calls for a form of surrogate listening--using the machine in place of the ear. Building on Bernsteins work and toward Clements, I suggest Machine-Aided Close Listening as a methodology that uses data visualization as a prosthetic extension of the ear. This is to say that by considering three dimensions of the phonotext--1) the textual manifestation of the poem, 2) the audio of the poet performing it, and 3) a visualization of that audio--the reader-listener can empirically confirm the ears …","charles bernstein, methodology, sonic materiality, human ear, data visualization, prosthetic synaesthesia, tanya clement, distant listening, 3d phonotext"

Finally, the method was implemented as a web application.","semantic association, phonetic word association, semanphone, new english vocabulary, longest common subsequence, verbal learning, phonetic associations"
"Buzz and Pipelines: Knowledge and Decision-Making in a Global Business Services PrecinctThis paper provides a historical analysis of an urban services district through its examination of the Melbourne wool trade precinct in the 1920s. It is a study of both a local and global community whose social and spatial interaction facilitated large-scale trade of a complex commodity that has rarely been examined. Geographic mapping of the local and global connections of the precinct has been combined with archival evidence. It reveals the “buzz” of the Melbourne precinct, created by local social and professional connections among wool brokers and buyers. “Pipelines” to wool growing and textile regions were developed through overseas branches of firms, with global knowledge exchanged through correspondence, telegraph, and migration. These features shaped the progress of the trade, facilitating improvements in its infrastructure and in the ability of Melbourne’s wool brokers and buyers to fulfill their role as …","melbourne wool trade precinct, spatial interaction, global connections, historical analysis, urban services district, wool brokers, pipelines, professional connections, wool growing, buzz, knowledge"

"On Not Writing a Review about Mirador: Mirador, IIIF, and the Epistemological Gains of Distributed Digital Scholarly ResourcesThis piece mushroomed from a simple enough looking suggestion to write a review about Mirador, a viewer component for web based image resources. While playing around and testing Mirador however, a lot of questions started to emerge–questions that in a scholarly sense were more significant than just the functional requirements of textual scholars and researchers of medieval sources for an image viewer. These questions are forced upon us because of the way Mirador is built, and by the assumptions it thereby makes–or that its developers make–about its role and about the larger infrastructure for scholarly resources that it is supposed to be a part of. This again led to a number of epistemological issues in the realm of digital textual scholarship. And so, what was intended as a simple review resulted in a long read about Mirador, about its technological context, and about digital scholarly editions as distributed resources. The first part of my story gives a straightforward review-like overview of Mirador. I then delve into the reasons that I think exist for the architectural nature of the majority of current digital scholarly editions, which are still mostly monolithic data silos. This in turn leads to some epistemological questions about digital scholarly editions. Subsequently I return to Mirador to investigate whether its architectural assumptions provide an answer to these epistemological issues. To estimate whether the epistemological “promise” that Mirador’s architecture holds may be easily attained, I gauge what (technical) effort is associated with building a digital edition that actually utilizes Mirador. Integrating Mirador also implies adopting the emerging …","mirador, image resources, epistemological gains, scholarly sense, viewer component"
"Pre-visualizationThis position paper argues that deep collaboration must be a part of any humanities visualization project and it investigates the nature and the place of such collaboration. I re-introduce the term ""previsualization” to refer to the interdisciplinary, transmedial critical work that underlies the design and implementation of, as well as the critical reflection on, visualization. I argue for seeing previsualization more than just in its temporal sense of a “first step” of building visual systems, but as a necessary process of digital humanities modelling that contributes to critical linkages between visualization and the humanities research tradition. Finally, I discuss the tension inherent in visual systems between their specificity and generalizability and the need to remain critical as they grow.","critical reflection, visual systems, humanities visualization project, deep collaboration, critical linkages, position"

"Screening for mild cognitive impairment in older adults through card gamesThis project researches the ability to screen for mild cognitive impairment through casual games. We hypothesize that by using games older adults play out of intrinsic motivation (such as card games), adherence will be better. This will lead to a more thorough and clear cognitive profile. Opposed to classical screening tests, the ability of repeated frequent self-screening allows to detect within-subject trends. This form of screening in real life settings also avoids contamination of results due to the clinical setting. We advocate the integration of these self-screening tests in the medical world to detect mild cognitive impairment.","games, older adults, classical screening tests, mild cognitive impairment, intrinsic motivation, real life settings, clear cognitive profile, withinsubject trends, frequent selfscreening"

"From a distance ‘You might mistake her for a man’: A closer reading of gender and character action in Jane Eyre, The Law and the Lady, and A Brilliant WomanThis research examines and contributes to recent work by Matthew Jockers and Gabi Kirilloff on the relationship between gender and action in the nineteenth-century novel. Jockers and Kirilloff use dependency parsing to extract verb and gendered pronoun pairs (‘he said’,‘she walked’, etc.). They then build a classification model to predict the gender of a pronoun based on the verb being performed. This present study examines the novels that were categorized as outliers by the classification model to gain a better understanding of the way the observed trends function at the level of individual narratives. We argue that while the classifier successfully categorized and identified novels in which characters behave unconventionally—that is, in ways not typical to the corpus as a whole—the rhetorical effects of these unconventional novels (and the extent to which their authors openly question nineteenth-century gender …","classification model, jane eyre, gabi kirilloff, pronoun pairs, character action, action, novels, matthew jockers, closer reading, brilliant womanthis research, nineteenthcentury, gender"
"How to control hate speech and hoaxes: Character language for character citizensThis research explores hate speech and hoaxes. It proposes a character language formulation to control them. This research paper is aimed at identifying the principles and values of character language which are expected to be effective in character education for the 21st century global citizens. This qualitative research employs two methods: grounded theory and autoethnography. The data obtained from theory reviews of hate speech and hoaxes through interpretive techniques are then further analyzed using a coding technique. The coding technique is used to find the main characteristics of hate speech and hoaxes. The principles and values of character language are applied as a means of controlling them, by reducing their textual transactions or avoiding them completely in communication.

"Off the Grid: Visualizing a Numismatic Collection as Dynamic Piles and StreamsThis research explores the merit of alternative arrangements of cultural artifacts to expose the aesthetic abundance of a cultural collection. The conventional display of museum objects in online interfaces tends to neglect the physical gestalt of the collection. For example, coins typically end up in tabular grids of thumbnail pages in online collections mimicking their rigid placement in storage drawers of a depot and glass cabinets in exhibitions. The overall aim behind this research was to devise visualizations that do justice to the material and semantic richness of an entire collection, while providing a casual mode of access that is inviting to people with no background in numismatics. To do this, we undertook an iterative design process, which involved a close collaboration with numismaticians and playful ideation with actual coins. Carefully negotiating expert knowledge and lay curiosity, the resulting visualization represents the collection’s dimensions using thousands of thumbnails as visual data points. The coins can be arranged into various layouts such as piles representing, for example, metal types, or streams visualizing the ebb and flow of coins over the centuries. In the interface, one can play with the coins in a manner that would be unthinkable in a physical exhibition and that has not been tried in a digital display. The article reports on the overall research and design process of this project, the resulting interface concept and prototype, and the feedback received during two evaluations.","cultural artifacts, online interfaces, cultural collection, grid, conventional display, dynamic piles, numismatic collection, aesthetic abundance, alternative arrangements, museum objects, streamsthis research"
"Language of the Sea: Ideologies within Kabar dari Laut by Chairil AnwarThis research paper explores ideologies contained in the 1946 poem Kabar Dari Laut by Chairil Anwar. The main words Kabar and Laut are central in this poem. This interpretive exploration tries to find out the ideologies contained in the phrase Kabar (literally means news, however, it also rather to say story) and the ideology in the scripture of laut the sea and how the two sets of expressions speak out the restlessness of the noted poet Chairil Anwar. The research findings have shown that the news and the sea have been used by the frustrated author to speak out his regret, awareness, and hatred due to his broken-hearted soul upon his ex-lover in the past. The findings also show that the sea signifies the author’s small self to face and live in this abundant life (the sea). His hatred towards his ex-lover has remained sad memories and bad realities which the author bears in his time while he is writing the poem.","chairil anwar, laut, kabar dari, research findings, poet chairil anwar, language"

"Enhancing e-learning in old age.This study assesses the efficacy of e-learning content that has been adapted to cognitive styles in a sample of older adults. Since the personalisation of learning content has been generally associated with learning processes, it was hypothesised that intrinsic motivation, metacognition and selfregulated learning and learning strategies would interact in affecting learning outcomes. A sample of 106 older adults attending the University of the Third Age was divided into two groups on the basis of the learning approach (face-to-face vs. online). Participants were asked to fill out questionnaires that assessed cognitive styles, learning processes and learning outcomes. A factorial ANOVA and path analysis were used. Findings confirmed the efficacy of adapting e-learning content to older adults cognitive styles, as well as the role played by intrinsic motivation, metacognition and self-regulated learning, and learning …","cognitive styles, learning processes, content, older adults, intrinsic motivation, factorial anova"
"Evaluating language models of tonal harmonyThis study borrows and extends probabilistic language models from natural language processing to discover the syntactic properties of tonal harmony. Language models come in many shapes and sizes, but their central purpose is always the same: to predict the next event in a sequence of letters, words, notes, or chords. However, few studies employing such models have evaluated the most state-of-the-art architectures using a large-scale corpus of Western tonal music, instead preferring to use relatively small datasets containing chord annotations from contemporary genres like jazz, pop, and rock.Using symbolic representations of prominent instrumental genres from the common-practice period, this study applies a flexible, data-driven encoding scheme to (1) evaluate Finite Context (or n-gram) models and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in a chord prediction task;(2) compare predictive accuracy from the best-performing models for chord onsets from each of the selected datasets; and (3) explain differences between the two model architectures in a regression analysis. We find that Finite Context models using the Prediction by Partial Match (PPM) algorithm outperform RNNs, particularly for the piano datasets, with the regression model suggesting that RNNs struggle with particularly rare chord types.","western tonal music, chord, syntactic properties, language models, datasets, tonal harmony"
"The Temporal role in Grammatical Performance of Foreign Language Learners of EnglishThis study evaluates the effects of length of formal learning time on the grammatical performance of English morphosyntactic structures among Iranian foreign language learners. Among different factors affecting language learning, the length of formal language exposure or language input is introduced as an important factor in language learning process. Thus, length of receiving input exposure in the form of formal classroom instruction in the current study is carefully studied by categorizing the participants in four different groups. The participants represented different exposure time groups by having various formal instruction hours at school and/or language center. In order to investigate the role of formal learning time on the performance of the individual morphosyntactic structures, the participants were presented to a timed Grammaticality Judgment Task. The task tested eleven different morphosyntactic structures and contained 132 sentences. The participants were asked to judge the grammaticality of the sentences and do the necessary corrections if needed. Repeated Measures ANOVA and regression analyses were performed to analyse the data. Results revealed the contribution of time on the performance of the individual structures.","iranian foreign language learners, grammatical performance, foreign language learners, performance, formal language exposure, formal classroom instruction, language learning, individual morphosyntactic structures"
". The nature of power and control in the interrogative patterns of selected Nigerian courtroom discourseThis study examines power relations in two different but interrelated courtroom trials within the Nigerian socio-judicial space. One reports barrister-questioning strategies in the course of legal proceedings concerning a land dispute, and the other focuses on two election petition tribunal trials involving various barrister-witness dialogues. This article highlights the way language is used as a symbol of power in the two courtroom dialogues. Moreover, it considers questioning procedures in conjunction with the forms of witnesses’ answers and how these reproduce the nature of power and control in this institutional setting. Drawing on pragmatics and insights from Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), we show that courtroom conventions as well as social circumstances impose some constraints on what is said and how it is said. Some insights might, thus, be gained as to the extent in which social and other extra-judicial …","power, interrelated courtroom trials, nigerian courtroom discoursethis, nigerian sociojudicial space, nature, control, critical discourse analysis, land dispute, power relations, interrogative patterns, social circumstances"
"A comparison of machine learning techniques for taxonomic classification of teeth from the Family BovidaeThis study explores the performance of machine learning algorithms on the classification of fossil teeth in the Family Bovidae. Isolated bovid teeth are typically the most common fossils found in southern Africa and they often constitute the basis for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Taxonomic identification of fossil bovid teeth, however, is often imprecise and subjective. Using modern teeth with known taxons, machine learning algorithms can be trained to classify fossils. Previous work by Brophy et al. Quantitative morphological analysis of bovid teeth and implications for paleoenvironmental reconstruction of plovers lake, Gauteng Province, South Africa, J. Archaeol. Sci. 41 (2014), pp. 376–388 uses elliptical Fourier analysis of the form (size and shape) of the outline of the occlusal surface of each tooth as features in a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) framework.

"A Contrastive Analysis between English Idioms and Their Indonesian Translations in the Novel The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins (2015)This study explores to find out the similarities, the differences, and the learning problems in a particular context, through a contrastive analysis. The researchers have employed a descriptive, qualitative method during the research since the aim of this study is to find out the similarities, differences, and the learning problems of English idiom and its Indonesian translation in the novel The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins (2015). Based on the analysis that has been done, the researchers have found out that there are 16 verbal idioms, 6 informal idioms, 4 idioms with special keywords, 2 idioms related to special themes, and 2 idiomatic pairs. About the similarities and differences, the researchers have concluded that there are 13 of 16 English idioms similar to its Indonesian translations and 3 of them different. In the informal idiom-type, there are 3 English idioms similar to its Indonesian translations and also there are 3 English idioms different from its Indonesian translations. In the idioms with special-keyword type, there is no English idiom similar to its Indonesian translation, but there are 4 English idioms that are different from its Indonesian translations. In the idioms related to special-theme type, there are 2 English idioms similar to its Indonesian translations and there is no difference. In the idiomatic-pair type, there are 2 English idioms similar to its Indonesian translations, but there is no difference in this type. Indonesian learners should note these similarities and differences between English idiom and its Indonesian translation in the novel, so they will not face learning problems or make translating mistakes when translating idioms from English …","qualitative method, paula hawkins, indonesian learners, informal idioms, informal idiomtype, verbal idioms, contrastive analysis, english idioms"

"Dotmocracy and Planning Poker for Uncertainty Management in Collaborative Research: Two Examples of Co-creation Techniques Derived from Digital CultureThis study is an exploratory approach to two co-creation methods derived from digital culture, applied to collaborative research ideation and management. Specifically, it describes and analyses the use of dotmocracy (from participatory design) and planning poker (from Agile frameworks) for decision-taking and uncertainty management in the early definition of collaborative research processes. The analysis, based on participant observation and facilitation in nine collaborative research settings, identifies commonalities on how some issues of uncertainty in collaborative knowledge generation contexts can be addressed by both techniques. Results point to the possibility of using dotmocracy and planning poker for articulating decision-making processes among different available options, in order to find consensus in a visual way, and at the same time to make more explicit the degree of agreement and risk …","participatory design, collaborative research, cocreation methods, dotmocracy, cocreation techniques, uncertainty management, planning poker, agile frameworks, digital culture, exploratory approach"
"Towards a New Exploratory Phase in Research on East European Cultures of DissentThis survey will contribute to core activities of the COST Action 16213, New Exploratory Phase in Research on East European Cultures of Dissent (NEP4DISSENT, 2017-2021). We are an international and multidisciplinary scholarly network some 170 people strong, funded by the COST Association in the framework of the Horizon 2020 Work Programme of the EU.  NEP4DISSENT is founded upon the conviction that resistance and dissent in former socialist Europe 1945-1989 constitutes a remarkable chapter of Europe’s recent past, which not only informs in a decisive way the identities of post-socialist societies today, but has also reshaped the continent as a whole and still provides an important reference for contemporary social movements worldwide.  Building on the achievements of this field of study and the respective domain of cultural heritage, NEP4DISSENT will trigger the next phase in the discovery of that legacy through forging new, reflexive approaches and providing a platform for creating an international research network, designed to cross-fertilize and consolidate national research agendas and incubate novel collaborative initiatives, taking advantage of cutting-edge digital humanities tools and methods, as well as strengthening the capacity for dissemination through cooperation with art and cultural heritage curators.","research, dissentthis survey, exploratory phase, east european cultures, multidisciplinary scholarly network, cost association, cultural heritage, cost action"
"Nineteenth-Century Knowledge ProjectThis talk will discuss the progress of a three-year-old project to build an extensive, open, digital collection for studying the structure of nineteenth-century knowledge by creating usable text from historic editions of the Encyclopedia Britannica. Today, we readily recognize a pervasive bias in the Eurocentrism of these entries, among other flaws. But at the time, the Britannica editions were the most authoritative comprehensive representation in the English-speaking world of knowledge as a whole. Knowledge has changed not just since that time but also during the publication of this material, from 1790-1911. This data set documents those changes. The goal of this project is identify patterns in the transformation of knowledge by mining the final data set. All of these works are available on the web, but their textual data is too inaccurate for valid text mining. This project thus creates the first accurate TEI edition of this valuable resource. The full corpus consists of 100,000 articles derived from 80,000 print pages. The TEI will be supplement with metadata using Named Entity Recognition. The Metadata Research Center at Drexel University will further enrich the data by adding subject metadata from both current and historical vocabularies, using an automated recognition program they developed. When complete, all individual entries will be made freely available through the Oxford Text Archive. It will be uploaded for other researchers in bulk form to the CORE Repository of the Humanities Commons.","nineteenthcentury knowledge, threeyearold project, project, usable text, tei, knowledge projectthis, metadata, recognition, historic editions, pervasive bias, knowledge, digital collection"
"Articulations of Value in the Humanities: The Contemporary Neoliberal University and Our Victorian InheritanceThis thesis traces the shift from liberal to neoliberal education from the nineteenth century to the present day, in order to provide a rich and previously underdeveloped narrative of value in higher education in England. Rather than attempting to justify the value of the humanities within the presiding economic frameworks, or writing a defence against market rationalism, this thesis offers an original contribution through an immersion in historical, financial, and critical debates concerning educational policy. Drawing upon close reading and discursive analysis, this thesis constructs a nuanced map of the intersections of value in the humanities. The discussion encompasses an exploration of policymaking practices, scientific discourse, mediated representations, and public cultural life.    The structure of the thesis is as follows. The introductory chapter outlines the overarching methodology by defining the contemporary period of this project (2008-14), establishing relevant scholarship, and drawing out the correspondences between the nineteenth century and the present day. Chapter one establishes a history of the Payment by Results approach in policymaking, first established in the Revised Code of Education (1862) and recently re-introduced in the reforms of the Browne Report (2010). Understanding the predominance of such short-term and quantitative policy is essential for detailing how value is articulated. Chapter two reconsiders the two cultures debate. In contrast to the misrepresentative, yet pervasive, perception that the sciences and the humanities are fundamentally in opposition, I propose a more nuanced history of these disciplines.

"A Sociological Approach to Poetry Translation: Modern European Poet-TranslatorsThis volume provides an in-depth comparative study of translation practices and the role of the poet-translator across different countries and in so doing, demonstrates the need for poetry translation to be extended beyond close reading and situated in context. Drawing on a corpus composed of data from national library catalogues and Worldcat, the book examines translation practices of English-language, French-language, and Italian-language poet-translators through the lens of a broad sociological approach. Chapters 2 through 5 look at national poetic movements, literary markets, and the historical and socio-political contexts of translations, with Chapter 6 offering case studies of prominent and representative poet-translators from each tradition. A comprehensive set of appendices offers readers an opportunity to explore this data in greater detail. Taken together, the volume advocates for the need to study translation data against broader aesthetic, historical, and political trends and will be of particular interest to students and scholars in translation studies and comparative literature.","national library catalogues, comparative, poettranslators, poetry translation, close reading, translation practices, literary markets, sociological approach, data, european poettranslatorsthis"
"Authenticity and cultural heritage in the age of 3D digital reproductionsThis volume represents the first attempt to collate an organic collection of contributions on authenticity and the digital realm in heritage and archaeology. It analyses the concept of authenticity from different perspectives and with different multidisciplinary contributions, together with theoretical debate. The collection of papers explores the concept of authenticity in a comprehensive way, engaging with theories relating to the commodification of ancient material culture, heritage-making processes, scholarly views and community engagement. These papers also take into account current digital practices for the study of past material culture and how their use affects and redefines interpretation processes in archaeology. This will provide a key reference text for archaeologists, museum and heritage specialists, and other readers interested in authenticity, cultural heritage and 3D reproductions.","3d reproductions, organic collection, material, digital realm, cultural heritage, authenticity"

"Aspect-based summarization of pros and cons in unstructured product reviewsThis work is a compression of 2. We implemented and evaluated a rule-based and a data-driven approach to aspect-based sentiment analysis, with a focus on Dutch product reviews of electronic devices on the platform kieskeurig. nl. The rule-based system matches review texts to a set of syntactic patterns and a valency lexicon: any phrase that matches a heuristically set syntactic pattern and a positive or negative word in the Duoman lexicon 1 is extracted as a pro or con. The data-driven approach leverages the pros and cons put forward by the writers of the reviews themselves. About 30% of the users make the effort to fill in these pros and cons fields. We implemented two versions of supervised classification: a shallow neural network trained on the original pros and cons and a shallow neural network trained on clusters of the pros and cons. The second version served to reduce the variety in pros and cons that was seen (eg: many different expressions to communicate a similar evaluation), and was implemented as K-means clustering with a target of 100 clusters. We trained, developed and tested our systems on a dataset of 4.575 reviews, more or less equally divided over four types of devices: vaccuum cleaners, deep fryers, espresso machines and smartphones. We added a baseline that matched known pros and cons from the training set to N-grams in the test reviews. While the pros and cons put forward by the users offers a gold standard for evaluation, we also included a human evaluation in which the qualities of both the system-generated summaries and the human-generated summaries are assessed.

"Can Scotland She Off its Violent ReputationThis work is the first national history of crime in Scotland. Indeed, there are few, if any, truly national histories of crime for any other country in the West. Consequently, this volume makes a significant contribution to our understanding of crime, its perpetrators, its victims, and the official reactions to felonious behaviour in the past. Moreover, by producing a nationally extensive study over such a long chronology, this study is also unique, as to date, no other work has investigated the history of crime over the three centuries analysed here. For these reasons and owing to the depth of research conducted into a vast array of source material (both authoritative and popular in origin), this work makes a landmark contribution to scholarship on the history of crime.","history, national histories, significant contribution"
"Analysis of the optical feedback dynamics in InAs/GaAs quantum dot lasers directly grown on siliconThis work reports on a systematic investigation of the influence of optical feedback in InAs/GaAs quantum dot lasers epitaxially grown on silicon. The boundaries associated to the onset of the critical feedback level corresponding to the first Hopf bifurcation are extracted at different bias conditions with respect to the onset of the first excited state transition. Overall, results show that quantum dot lasers directly grown onto silicon are much more resistant to optical feedback than quantum well lasers, mostly resulting from a small linewidth enhancement factor of high-quality quantum dot material. However, results also unveil that the onset of the critical feedback level strongly depends on the excited-to-ground-state ratio, hence a figure of merit showing that a small ratio of the excited-to-ground-state lasing thresholds is not beneficial for maintaining a high degree of stability. This work brings further insights in the …","analysis, excitedtogroundstate ratio, optical feedback, systematic investigation, quantum dot, optical feedback dynamics"
"Approaching French theatrical characters by syntactical analysis: a study with motifs and correspondence analysisThis work uses computational approaches to study literature. It addresses the question of characterisation in theatrical plays, concentrating on the work of Molière, and trying to identify distinctive traits in the “voices” of some of the famous characters created by the French playwright. The used technique adopts a syntagmatic approach, targeting differences in the distribution of sequences of grammatical categories, derived from texts in a bottom up way. First of all morpho-syntactic motifs of length 3 to 5 are extracted from the lines of each character with the help of a sequential pattern mining algorithm; then the differences in the distribution of such motifs across the characters are investigated by means of Correspondence Analysis. In the first experiment four well known Molière protagonists (Harpagon, Dom Juan, Scapin, Sganarelle) are compared; in the second one a set of minor characters (the so called “Reasoners”) are investigated. The combined conclusions of the two proposed experiments highlight the complex intersection between voice and register in determining the stylistic choices of the author. In order for his characters to be perceived as realistic, Molière not only provides them with a distinctive voice, but also models their dialogue according to the communicative function they fulfil in the play.","distinctive traits, molière, syntactical analysis, french theatrical characters, theatrical plays, computational approaches"

This essay is therefore a critical engagement with that longstanding interest to show what it is possible to do, over what period, and why. It concludes that certain projects simply cannot be undertaken without further investment by the American Psychological Association. This is because forgotten changes in the assumptions informing the database make its index terms untrustworthy for use in trend-tracking before 1967. But they can indeed be used, with care, to track more recent trends. The result is then a Distant Reading of psychology, with Digital History presented as enabling a kind of Science Studies that psychologists will find appealing.

"Toward a feminist modernist digital humanitiesThough the digital humanities (DH) has offered feminist scholars new opportunities for publishing neglected authors, the rhetoric of science and quantification that accompanies it runs counter to core insights of feminist modernist scholarship, which have questioned the possibility and desirability of scientific virtues of empiricism and neutrality. By applying Donna Haraway’s situated knowledges – and its renewal in the digital humanities through intersectional feminist scholars such as Roopika Risam and Moya Bailey – this article explores the costs that sexism within DH has already levied on modernist studies. Further, it argues that the future of modernist DH scholarship must be explicitly feminist in nature, translating key insights from feminist theory into concrete practices for digital modernist scholarship. Collaboration emerges as an overarching ethos and an essential method for feminist modernist studies.","core insights, feminist modernist, feminist scholars"

Examination of his rhetoric evidences that he often is engaged not in the reduction but rather the enhancement of judicial discretion, his own.","justice scaliathrough, judicial interpretation, originalist textualism, rhetoric, judicial discretion, reasonable person, justice scalia"

"Digital Art as “Monetised Graphics”: Enforcing Intellectual Property on the BlockchainThroughout this book I have examined whether net art should be part of mainstream artworlds, which are typified by art historian and critic Claire Bishop as ‘commercial galleries, the Turner Prize, national pavilions at Venice’ (b:436). It could be said that similar to earlier disciplines like photography, video and film, net art will become part of established art systems, in one form or another. As Bishop affirms, ‘no exhibition is complete without some form of bulky, obsolete technology’ (b:436). Indeed, sales of net art at art fairs are increasing, and slowly net art is acquired by museums. However, if the amount of attention from different audiences is an indication, then net art does not depend on this mainstream. As stated by :486), the audience for net art far exceeds the visitor numbers of any contemporary art museum.

When visitors come to conferences and attend events in Australia, non-indigenous persons make a formal acknowledgement of Country that recognizes the unique status of Aboriginal people as the original owners and custodians of the land and waters of Australia. This cultural protocol and performance ritual–enacted before any public event–is also therefore an opportunity to think deeply about the intersections between geography, biology, climates and indigenous history.

"Ecosystems Knowledge: Modeling and Analysis Method for Information and CommunicationTo analyze complex situations we use everyday analogies that allow us to invest in an unknown domain knowledge we have acquired in a known field. In this work the author proposes a modeling and analysis method that uses the analogy of the ecosystem to embrace the complexity of an area of knowledge. After a history of the ecosystem concept and these derivatives (nature, ecology, environment) from antiquity to the present, the analysis method based on the modeling of socio-semantic ontologies is presented, followed by practical examples of this approach in the areas of software development, digital humanities, Big Data, and more generally in the area of complex analysis.","sociosemantic ontologies, ecosystems knowledge, complex situations, analysis method"
"Nuit Debout| Activist Reflexivity and Mediated Violence: Putting the Policing of Nuit Debout in ContextTo better understand the historical trajectory of the policing of Nuit Debout, in this article we argue that the reflexive relationship between police and protest tactics is heavily mediated by the presence of the press and by the emergence of digital technologies. Our analysis focuses on three sets of reflexive activist practice:(a) challenging media representations—the adaptations and innovations that respond to dominant media framing of police–protester relations;(b)“sousveillance” and police monitoring—the recording and monitoring of police violence and the public education around the police’s use of force;(c) civic forensics and data aggregation—the gathering, analyzing, and collectivizing of citizen-generated data. Although not intended as a taxonomy, these groups of practices are offered as conceptual lenses for critically examining how activists’ tactical repertoires for protesting police adapt and evolve, building on each other to challenge the representational, legal, and material dimensions of state power as it manifests in police–protester relations.","police, protester, protest tactics, media representations, reflexive relationship, historical trajectory, dominant media framing, digital technologies, nuit debout, mediated violence"
"Interaction Ritual Threads: Does IRC Theory Apply Online?To broaden IRC theory’s scope, we emphasize, first, structural features of different communicative genres and, second, a wider range of mechanisms through which the effects of such features as focus and entrainment are transmitted. Both structure and mechanisms, we argue, vary markedly between face-to-face and computer-mediated interaction. We suggest that the faceto-face communication genres on which Collins’s work has focused are special (albeit especially important) cases of the broader range of phenomena to which the theory applies.","irc theory, interaction, structural features, facetoface, interaction ritual threads"
"Revisiting the cluster-based paradigm for implicit search result diversificationTo cope with ambiguous and/or underspecified queries, search result diversification (SRD) is a key technique that has attracted a lot of attention. This paper focuses on implicit SRD, where the subtopics underlying a query are unknown. Many existing methods appeal to the greedy strategy for generating diversified results. A common practice is using a heuristic criterion for making the locally optimal choice at each round. As a result, it is difficult to know whether the failures are caused by the optimization criterion or the setting of parameters. Different from previous studies, we formulate implicit SRD as a process of selecting and ranking k exemplar documents through integer linear programming (ILP). The key idea is that: for a specific query, we expect to maximize the overall relevance of the k exemplar documents. Meanwhile, we wish to maximize the representativeness of the selected exemplar documents with …","clusterbased paradigm, integer linear programming, heuristic criterion, implicit srd, exemplar documents, common practice, query, greedy strategy, srd, underspecified queries"
"Learning from Rome:: Making Sense of Complex Built Environments in the Digital AgeTo walk through a city, stroll down a street, and pause in a public square is to be enveloped in history. 1 But people typically pass through built environments without considering them as totalities of topography, architecture, and human history—like hiking a landscape without understanding its geology and ecology. Scholars, however, seek to grasp how and why humans have formed and re-formed built environments, preserving, altering, or destroying fabric over time. With the advent of digital, data-driven approaches and increasingly powerful mapping tools, can we better make sense of complex, historically rich built environments?The case of Rome offers an ideal opportunity to address this question.

"TSFEPS: WP4, Italian Case studies report; Dept. of Sociology & Social ResearchToday, leading scholars of international public management note that co-production has become one of the cornerstones of public policy reforms worldwide . Earlier, a seminal OECD report (2011) on co-production called for rethinking traditional public service delivery in a new socio-economic environment. It argued that existing models of public service provision are not only tenuous, but also not affordable in the long-run. This lent greater urgency to developing alternative models that focus on citizen participation in the design and delivery of public services or co-production. But, it also noted that by involving citizens/users in more systematic exchanges with the paid staff who deliver public services, co-production transforms the relationship between service users and providers, ensuring the former greater influence and ownership.

Such methods can also help us organize and navigate large text corpora. Popular tools for this task range from Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) 8 which uses standard linear algebra, to deep learning which relies on non-convex optimization. This paper concerns topic modeling which posits a simple probabilistic model of how a document is generated. We give a formal description of the generative model at the end of the section, but next we will outline its important features.

"Collecting the Past: British Collectors and their Collections from the 18th to the 20th CenturiesToday’s libraries and museums are heavily indebted to the passions and obsessions of numerous individual collectors who devoted their lives to amassing collections of books, manuscripts, artworks, and other culturally significant objects. Collecting the Past brings together the latest research on a wide range of significant British collectors from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries, including Hans Sloane, Sarah Sophia Banks, Thomas Phillipps, Sydney Cockerell, JP Morgan Jnr., Alfred Chester Beatty and RE Hart. Contributors to the volume examine the phenomenon of collecting in a variety of settings and across a range of different materials. Considering the aims and motives that led these collectors to assemble such remarkable collections, the book also examines the history of these collections after the collector’s death. Particular attention is given to the often complicated relationship between collectors and the public institutions that subsequently came to house their collections. Situated within the framework of cultural collecting more generally, this book offers an authoritative series of essays on key collectors. Collecting the Past should be most interesting to researchers, academics and postgraduate students engaged in the study of museum studies, book history, manuscript studies, museum history, library history and the history of collecting. Professionals in libraries, museums and galleries will also find the volume of great interest.","british collectors, 20th centuriestoday, collections, history, sarah sophia banks"

"Evaluating the Utilization of Line Snugglers in Protecting and Organizing Central Lines in a Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant PopulationTopic Significance & Study Purpose/Background/RationaleChildren undergoing a bone marrow transplant (BMT) require central lines and connected intravenous tubing (IV) for care. Unfortunately, children play with and inadvertently disconnect, tangle, chew, or spill fluids on the lines. These events increase risk of developing a Central Line Associated Blood Stream Infection. Recently, a nurse invented nursing product labeled the Line Snuggler, has provided a means to protect lines from such contamination or entanglement. Line Snugglers are waterproof sleeves, or vests with waterproof sleeves, that cover the connection points between the IV tubing and central line lumens extending 20-30” toward the IV pole.Methods, Intervention, & AnalysisThe specific aim is to evaluate clinical utilization and consumer satisfaction of Line Snugglers in the pediatric BMT population.

"Progressive learning of topic modeling parameters: a visual analytics frameworkTopic modeling algorithms are widely used to analyze the thematic composition of text corpora but remain difficult to interpret and adjust. Addressing these limitations, we present a modular visual analytics framework, tackling the understandability and adaptability of topic models through a user-driven reinforcement learning process which does not require a deep understanding of the underlying topic modeling algorithms. Given a document corpus, our approach initializes two algorithm configurations based on a parameter space analysis that enhances document separability. We abstract the model complexity in an interactive visual workspace for exploring the automatic matching results of two models, investigating topic summaries, analyzing parameter distributions, and reviewing documents.

"Toponym matching through deep neural networksToponym matching, i.e. pairing strings that represent the same real-world location, is a fundamental problemfor several practical applications. The current state-of-the-art relies on string similarity metrics, either specifically developed for matching place names or integrated within methods that combine multiple metrics. However, these methods all rely on common sub-strings in order to establish similarity, and they do not effectively capture the character replacements involved in toponym changes due to transliterations or to changes in language and culture over time. In this article, we present a novel matching approach, leveraging a deep neural network to classify pairs of toponyms as either matching or nonmatching. The proposed network architecture uses recurrent nodes to build representations from the sequences of bytes that correspond to the strings that are to be matched. These representations are then …","deep neural networkstoponym matching, similarity metrics"
"Agroecological transitions: What can sustainability transition frameworks teach us? An ontological and empirical analysisTransitioning toward more sustainable agricultural development paths requires extensive change and not simply marginal technical adjustments, as suggested by a strong conception of agroecology. To deal with transition, we believe that agroecology can be enriched by a deep analysis of sustainability transition frameworks and, conversely, that preexisting theories can be questioned in light of the specificities of agroecological transitions (AET). We first examine some of the main sustainability transition frameworks (resilience of social-ecological systems, institutional analysis and development of social-ecological systems, and socio-technical transition). We identify their ontologies to question their ability to be combined without deep adjustments. In a second step, we analyze how these frameworks have been used and questioned by researchers from the life sciences or social sciences in four AET studies. We find that each framework is relevant in its systemic and dynamic approach to change, but also that there are limits concerning the balance between the various dimensions. The scales and processes linked to AET must be taken into account, as well as the way to jointly consider ecological, socioeconomic, and technological aspects. Moreover, it is clear that problems in dealing with agency are common to these approaches, which influences the way to model change. More broadly, sustainability transition frameworks need to account better for ecological and technological materialities and processes, the importance of emergent organizations in singular situations, and learning processes and the diversity of knowledge dynamics. Doing so is …","deep analysis, sustainable agricultural development paths, marginal technical adjustments, agroecological transitions, strong conception, sustainability transition, socialecological systems"
"Quantitative evaluation of perceived depth of transparently-visualized medical 3D data presented with a multi-view 3D displayTransparent visualization is used in many fields because it can visualize not only the frontal object but also other important objects behind it. Although in many situations, it would be very important for the 3D structures of the visualized transparent images to be perceived as they are simulated, little is known quantitatively as to how such transparent 3D structures are perceived. To address this question, in the present study, we conducted a psychophysical experiment in which the observers reported the perceived depth magnitude of a transparent object in medical images, presented with a multi-view 3D display. For the visualization, we employed a stochastic point-based rendering (SPBR) method, which was developed recently as a technique for efficient transparent-rendering. Perceived depth of the transparent object was smaller than the simulated depth. We found, however, that such depth underestimation can be …","frontal object, multiview 3d display, multiview 3d displaytransparent visualization, 3d structures, quantitative evaluation, transparent images, medical images, transparentlyvisualized medical 3d data, transparent object"
"Local Immunomodulation with Anti-inflammatory Cytokine-Encoding Lentivirus Enhances Functional Recovery after Spinal Cord InjuryTrauma to the spinal cord and associated secondary inflammation can lead to permanent loss of sensory and motor function below the injury level, with the resulting environment serving as a barrier that limits regeneration. In this study, we investigate the localized expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-4 via lentiviral transduction in multichannel bridges. Porous multichannel bridges provide physical guidance for axonal outgrowth with the cytokines hypothesized to modulate the neuroinflammatory microenvironment and enhance axonal regeneration. Gene expression analyses indicated that induced IL-10 and IL-4 expression decreased expression of pro-inflammatory genes and increased pro-regenerative genes relative to control. Moreover, these factors led to increased numbers of axons and myelination, with approximately 45% of axons myelinated and the number of oligodendrocyte myelinated …","spinal cord, porous multichannel bridges, spinal cord injurytrauma, motor function, localized expression, secondary inflammation, axonal outgrowth, antiinflammatory cytokines il10, permanent loss, multichannel bridges, local immunomodulation, genes"
"Using Weak Signal in NLPTreebanking requires substantial expert labour in the annotation of a variety of language phenomena. Possibly to a lesser extent for phenomena where laypeople can also contribute, the need for assigning manual labels nevertheless characterises almost all language processing tasks, since they are usually best solved by supervised models. Such models are indeed accurate, but we also know that they lack portability, as they are bound to languages, genres, and even specific datasets. Having spent years dealing with annotation issues and label acquisition for various semantic and pragmatic tasks, in this talk I take a radically different perspective, which hopefully can yield interesting reflections over treebanking, too. I will show various ways to cheaply obtain and exploit weaker signal in supervised learning, even venturing on the suggestion to reduce existing strong, accurate signal in order to enhance portability …","lesser extent, language phenomena, weak signal, substantial expert labour, supervised models, language processing tasks, manual labels"

"Introduction to John Webster’s theater of (dis) obedience and damnationTwo critical memes haunt the literary history that passes judgment on John Webster’s importance as a dramatist: his socio-or psycho-pathology; and to what degree in comparison with Shakespeare’s sublime output he falls below Shakespeare as a successful artist. 1 The first meme posits a psychological profile for Webster by mapping its symptomology on the basis of an assessment of the characters and events of primarily two plays: The Duchess of Malfi and The White Devil. These two plays—both tragedies—function not as dramatic works in which genre authorizes and legitimizes meaning in terms of specific modes of representation and appropriate language but as the assumed determiners of a morbid state of mind and an imagination that, it is generally assumed, must be inimical to the production of truly great drama.

"Adoption of Drought-Tolerant Corn in the US: A Field-Level Analysis of Adoption Patterns and Emerging TrendsUS farmers have few short-run options for reducing downside production risk from changes in drought frequency and intensity due to ongoing climate change. However, one recent and increasingly-available option is adoption of drought-tolerant (DT) corn. By 2016, just over 22% of US corn acreage was planted to DT corn varieties. We determine how drought risk and recent drought exposure has led to this adoption. The empirical analysis is motivated by a state-contingent framework that accommodates farmers’ beliefs about future drought based on objective drought risk and exposure. Our discrete choice analysis suggests that exposure to 2013 and 2014 droughts led to increased adoption of DT varieties in 2016. Adoption is generally increasing in drought severity and exposure to long-run drought risk. Using model estimates, we predict increasing adoption under alternative scenarios of increasing short-run drought shocks and greater long-run drought risk.","drought frequency, droughttolerant corn, drought risk, fieldlevel analysis, adoption patterns, emerging trendsus farmers, shortrun, dt varieties"

"Comparison of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms in hybrid Kansei engineering system for product form designUnderstanding the affective needs of customers is crucial to the success of product design. Hybrid Kansei engineering system (HKES) is an expert system capable of generating products in accordance with the affective responses. HKES consists of two subsystems: forward Kansei engineering system (FKES) and backward Kansei engineering system (BKES). In previous studies, HKES was based primarily on single-objective optimization, such that only one optimal design was obtained in a given simulation run. The use of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) in HKES was only attempted using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), such that very little work has been conducted to compare different MOEAs. In this paper, we propose an approach to HKES combining the methodologies of support vector regression (SVR) and MOEAs. In BKES, we constructed predictive models using SVR …","support vector regression, affective responses, kansei engineering system, comparison, product design, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms"
"Unraveling Nanoscale Magnetic Ordering in Fe3O4 Nanoparticle Assemblies via X-raysUnderstanding the correlations between magnetic nanoparticles is important for nanotechnologies, such as high-density magnetic recording and biomedical applications, where functionalized magnetic particles are used as contrast agents and for drug delivery. The ability to control the magnetic state of individual particles depends on the good knowledge of the magnetic correlations between particles when assembled. Inaccessible via standard magnetometry techniques, nanoscale magnetic ordering in self-assemblies of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles is here unveiled via X-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS). Measured throughout the magnetization process, the XRMS signal reveals size-dependent inter-particle magnetic correlations. Smaller (5 nm) particles show little magnetic correlations, even when packed close together, yielding to magnetic disorder in the absence of an external field, ie, superparamagnetism. In contrast, larger (11 nm) particles tend to be more strongly correlated, yielding a mix of magnetic orders including ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic orders. These magnetic correlations are present even when the particles are sparsely distributed. View Full-Text","nanoscale magnetic ordering, orders, particles, xrms"
"Quantitative Evaluation of Music Copyright InfringementUnfounded music copyright lawsuits inhibit musical creativity and waste millions of taxpayer dollars annually. Our aim was to develop and test simple quantitative methods in order to supplement traditional qualitative musicological analyses and improve the efficiency and transparency of music copyright lawsuits. We adapted automatic sequence alignment algorithms from computational biology to create a"" percent melodic identity""(PMI) method that was initially developed to measure the cultural evolution of folk music from different cultures. This method automatically quantifies and visualizes the percentage of identical pitch classes shared between two melodic sequences. We applied the PMI method to a corpus of 20 pairs of melodies that had been the subject of legal decisions and that had previously been analyzed using automatic methods. We found that the PMI method was able to accurately predict 80%(16/20) of previous decisions, with PMIs below 50% usually resulting in decisions of no infringement (11/13 cases), and PMIs above 50% usually resulting in decisions of infringement (5/7 cases). Importantly, each of the four outlying cases could be explained by contextual factors not related to melodic similarity (eg, lyrics, access). Our results provide promise for improving music copyright evaluation by supplementing traditional qualitative components with quantitative methods and visualization tools that are simple enough to be useful to juries, judges, and other non-musicologists.","simple quantitative methods, automatic sequence alignment algorithms, music copyright, decisions, taxpayer dollars, traditional qualitative musicological analyses, melodic, quantitative evaluation, musical creativity, waste millions"
"Generation of customized dashboards through software product line paradigms to analyse university employment and employability dataUniversity employment and, specifically, employability has steadily gained relevance nowadays as the study of these fields can lead to improvement in the quality of life of individual citizens. However, the empirical research is still insufficient to make significant decisions within this domain. It is necessary to rely on powerful tools in order to reach insights about university employment and employability. Information dashboards have become a key software tool to reach insights and make informed decisions about a specific topic, domain or field of study. Nevertheless, dashboards’ users can have several requirements that differ from each other (including displayed information itself, design features or even functionalities), and it is necessary to take into account all of these specifications, allowing users to exploit data with its own necessities and aiming to its own goals. Applying software product line paradigms, it is plausible to face different requirements regarding information dashboards’ development in an efficient, scalable and maintainable way. To validate this approach, a case study is presented in the context of the Spanish Observatory of Employability and University Employment, an organization that aims to become an information reference for these fields.","individual citizens, decisions, empirical research, university employment, dashboards, employability datauniversity employment, information dashboards, software product line, employability, generation"

"Search for vectorlike light-flavor quark partners in proton-proton collisions at root s= 8 TeVVectorlike quarks (VLQs) are hypothetical spin-1= 2 fermions, whose left-and right-handed chiral components transform in the same way under the standard model (SM) symmetries, and hence have vector couplings to gauge bosons. Such VLQs appear in a number of models that extend the SM to address open questions in particle physics. These models include: beautiful mirrors 1, little-Higgs models 2–4, composite-Higgs models 5, theories invoking extra dimensions 6, grand unified theories 7, and models providing insights into the SM flavor structure 8.Owing to the possible role of third-generation quarks in the solution of problems in electroweak symmetry breaking, the VLQs in many of the aforementioned models mix predominantly with third generation quarks. In addition, indirect experimental constraints on the quark couplings of the lighter generations from precision electroweak measurements are typically stronger than those on thirdgeneration couplings 9. However, the coupling corrections from several different VLQs may cancel, which can significantly relax constraints on the mixing of VLQs with","protonproton collisions, tevvectorlike quarks, vector couplings, chiral components, lightflavor quark, electroweak, models, sm flavor structure"

Through macro and microreading we develop a taxonomy of aural experiences, and explore how changes to categories of silence from our taxonomy—for instance, the overall decline in mentions of absolute silence—provide clues to changes in the landscape and soundscape of the Lake District. Modern authors often contrast silence with anthropogenic sounds, while historical authors adhere to a cultural construction where the Lake District is presented as a tranquil area by ignoring industrial sounds.

Emphasis is placed on enzyme activities that have been functionally characterized, are associated with the parasite gut, and putatively contribute to degrading host proteins to absorbable nutrients 1–4. Often, gut proteases are expressed as multigene families, as is the case with Fasciola 5 and Haemonchus 6, presumably expanding the range of substrates that can be degraded, not least during parasite migration through host tissues 5. The application of the free-living planarian and Caenorhabditis elegans as investigative models for parasite cysteine proteases is discussed.

This development has mainly to do with the increasing availability of Internet, wireless and digital cartographic technologies. Specifi cally, the Internet, coupled with wireless technologies, provided archaeologists with unprecedented opportunities to circulate, access, edit, consult and populate digital maps. Digital cartographic technologies (especially geographical information systems), on the other hand, have rendered the collection, storage, querying, processing and display of archaeological spatial data ever more effi cient.","archaeology, piraye hacigüzellerwe, digital cartography, cartographic practices, digital cartographic technologies, digital maps"
"Improving OCR Accuracy on Early Printed Books by combining Pretraining, Voting, and Active LearningWe combine three methods which significantly improve the OCR accuracy of OCR mod-els trained on early printed books:(1) The pretraining method utilizes the informationstored in already existing models trained on a variety of typesets (mixed models) insteadof starting the training from scratch.(2) Performing cross fold training on a single setof ground truth data (line images and their transcriptions) with a single OCR engine (OCRopus) produces a committee whose members then vote for the best outcome byalso taking the top-N alternatives and their intrinsic confidence values into account.(3) Following the principle of maximal disagreement we select additional training lineswhich the voters disagree most on, expecting them to offer the highest informationgain for a subsequent training (active learning). Evaluations on six early printed booksyielded the following results: On average the combination of pretraining and votingimproved the character accuracy by 46% when training five folds starting from the samemixed model. This number rose to 53% when using different models for pretraining, underlining the importance of diverse voters. Incorporating active learning improvedthe obtained results by another 16% on average (evaluated on three of the six books). Overall, the proposed methods lead to an average error rate of 2.5% when training ononly 60 lines. Using a substantial ground truth pool of 1,000 lines brought the errorrate down even further to less than 1% on average.","active learningwe, early printed books, mixed models, training, ocr models, pretraining method, active learning"
"A Large-Scale Study of Language Models for Chord PredictionWe conduct a large-scale study of language models for chord prediction. Specifically, we compare N-gram models to various flavours of recurrent neural networks on a comprehensive dataset comprising all publicly available datasets of annotated chords known to us. This large amount of data allows us to systematically explore hyper-parameter settings for the recurrent neural networks---a crucial step in achieving good results with this model class. Our results show not only a quantitative difference between the models, but also a qualitative one: in contrast to static N-gram models, certain RNN configurations adapt to the songs at test time. This finding constitutes a further step towards the development of chord recognition systems that are more aware of local musical context than what was previously possible.","comprehensive dataset, language models, recurrent neural networks, ngram models, chord prediction"
"The Effect of Context on Metaphor Paraphrase Aptness JudgmentsWe conduct two experiments to study the effect of context on metaphor paraphrase aptness judgments. The first is an AMT crowd source task in which speakers rank metaphor paraphrase candidate sentence pairs in short document contexts for paraphrase aptness. In the second we train a composite DNN to predict these human judgments, first in binary classifier mode, and then as gradient ratings. We found that for both mean human judgments and our DNNs predictions, adding document context compresses the aptness scores towards the center of the scale, raising low out of context ratings and decreasing high out of context scores. We offer a provisional explanation for this compression effect.Subjects: Computation and Language (cs. CL)Cite as: arXiv: 1809.01060 cs. CL(or arXiv: 1809.01060 v1 cs.

"Right for the Right Reason: Training Agnostic NetworksWe consider the problem of a neural network being requested to classify images (or other inputs) without making implicit use of a"" protected concept"", that is a concept that should not play any role in the decision of the network. Typically these concepts include information such as gender or race, or other contextual information such as image backgrounds that might be implicitly reflected in unknown correlations with other variables, making it insufficient to simply remove them from the input features. In other words, making accurate predictions is not good enough if those predictions rely on information that should not be used: predictive performance is not the only important metric for learning systems. We apply a method developed in the context of domain adaptation to address this problem of"" being right for the right reason"", where we request a classifier to make a decision in a way that is entirelyagnosticto a given protected concept (eg gender, race, background etc.), even if this could be implicitly reflected in other attributes via unknown correlations. After defining the concept of anagnostic model, we demonstrate how the Domain-Adversarial Neural Network can remove unwanted information from a model using a gradient reversal layer.","neural network, network, unknown correlations, training agnostic networkswe, gender, accurate predictions, information"

"Model Retrieval by 3D Sketching in Immersive Virtual RealityWe describe a novel method for searching 3D model collections using free-form sketches within a virtual environment as queries. As opposed to traditional Sketch Retrieval, our queries are drawn directly onto an example model. Using immersive virtual reality the user can express their query through a sketch that demonstrates the desired structure, color and texture. Unlike previous sketch-based retrieval methods, users remain immersed within the environment without relying on textual queries or 2D projections which can disconnect the user from the environment. We show how a convolutional neural network (CNN) can create multi-view representations of colored 3D sketches. Using such a descriptor representation, our system is able to rapidly retrieve models and in this way, we provide the user with an interactive method of navigating large object datasets.

"3D sketching for interactive model retrieval in virtual realityWe describe a novel method for searching 3D model collections using free-form sketches within a virtual environment as queries. As opposed to traditional sketch retrieval, our queries are drawn directly onto an example model. Using immersive virtual reality the user can express their query through a sketch that demonstrates the desired structure, color and texture. Unlike previous sketch-based retrieval methods, users remain immersed within the environment without relying on textual queries or 2D projections which can disconnect the user from the environment.

We show how a convolutional neural network (CNN) can create multi-view representations of colored 3D sketches. Using such a descriptor representation, our system is able to rapidly retrieve models and in this way, we provide the user with an interactive method of navigating large object datasets. Through a user study we demonstrate that by using our VR 3D model retrieval system, users can perform search more quickly and intuitively than with a naive linear browsing method. Using our system users can rapidly populate a virtual environment with specific models from a very large database, and thus the technique has the potential to be broadly applicable in immersive editing systems.","3d model, virtual environment, traditional sketch retrieval, retrieval methods, model retrieval, freeform sketches"

"Aida: Intelligent Image Analysis to Automatically Detect Poems in Digital Archives of Historic NewspapersWe describe an intelligent image analysis approach to automatically detect poems in digitally archived historic newspapers. Our application, Image Analysis for Archival Discovery, or Aida, integrates computer vision to capture visual cues based on visual structures of poetic works—instead of the meaning or content—and machine learning to train an artificial neural network to determine whether an image has poetic text. We have tested our application on almost 17,000 image snippets and obtained promising accuracies, precision, and recall. The application is currently being deployed at two institutions for digital library and literary research.","application, historic newspapers, image analysis, visual cues, digital archives, visual structures, aida, historic newspaperswe"

The system, which we call SOFA (SOFA Ontological Fragment Assembler), demonstrates architectural design principles which may have more general applicability in the semantic music domain, notably the adoption of the Linked Data Platform to realise service components of the end-to-end pipeline so that data specialisation takes the place of service specialisation. The prototype builds upon two existing tools developed by the authors: Music Encoding and Linked Data (MELD), which augments and extends MEI structures with semantic Web Annotations capable of addressing musically meaningful score sections, and Numbers Into Notes, an algorithmic composition tool that acts as asemantic signal generatorto drive the tool chain.

"The translator’s visibility: Detecting translatorial fingerprints in contemporaneous parallel translationsWe detail the results of experiments towards a fine-grained stylometric analysis, the identification of distinguishing features between contemporaneous literary translations, both parallel works and also translations of non-parallel sets of works by the same author. We examine translations of plays by the Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen with the initial point of focus being the Ibsen drama Ghosts, for which there exists comparable contemporaneous translations by R. Farqhuarson Sharp and William Archer. Consequently, a number of prose translations of Russian author Anton Chekhov by Marian Fell and Constance Garnett are examined in order to validate hypotheses formed from the results of the Ibsen study and investigate possible particularities in translator’s style which may vary according to genre.","translator, translatorial fingerprints, norwegian dramatist henrik ibsen, stylometric analysis, nonparallel sets, parallel works, contemporaneous parallel translationswe"
"Imitation Learning for Neural Morphological String TransductionWe employ imitation learning to train a neural transition-based string transducer for morphological tasks such as inflection generation and lemmatization. Previous approaches to training this type of model either rely on an external character aligner for the production of gold action sequences, which results in a suboptimal model due to the unwarranted dependence on a single gold action sequence despite spurious ambiguity, or require warm starting with an MLE model. Our approach only requires a simple expert policy, eliminating the need for a character aligner or warm start. It also addresses familiar MLE training biases and leads to strong and state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.","string transducer, training, inflection generation, external character aligner, suboptimal model, imitation, gold action"
"From lexical bundles to surprisal and language modelsWe exploit the information theoretic measure of surprisal to analyze the formulaicity of lexical sequences. We first show the prevalence of individual lexical bundles, then we argue that abstracting to surprisal as an informationtheoretic measure of lexical bundleness, formulaicity and non-creativity is an appropriate measure for the idiom principle, as it expresses reader expectations and text entropy. As strong and gradient formulaic, idiomatic and selectional preferences prevail on all levels, we argue for the abstraction step from individual bundles to measures of bundleness. We use surprisal to analyse differences between genres of native language use, and learner language at different levels:(a) spoken and written genres of native language (L1);(b) spoken and written learner language (L2), across selected written genres;(c) learner language as compared with native language (L1). We thus test Pawley and Syder (1983)’s hypothesis that native speakers know best how to play the tug-of-war between formulaicity (Sinclair’s idiom principle) and expressiveness (Sinclair’s openchoice principle), which can be measured with Levy and Jaeger (2007)’s uniform information density (UID) which is a principle of minimizing comprehension difficulty. Our goal to abstract away from word sequences also leads us to language models as models of processing, first in the form of a part-of-speech tagger, then in the form of a syntactic parser. While our hypotheses are largely confirmed, we also observe that advanced learners bundle most, and that scientific language may show lower surprisal than spoken language.","lexical bundles, individual lexical bundles, language modelswe, informationtheoretic measure, learner language, native language, lexical sequences, principle"
"Graphical Partitions and Graphical RelationsWe generalize the well-known correspondence between partitions and equivalence relations on a set to the case of graphs and hypergraphs. This is motivated by the role that partitions and equivalence relations play in Rough Set Theory and the results provide some of the foundations needed to develop a theory of rough graphs. We use one notion of a partition of a hypergraph, which we call a graphical partition, and we show how these structures correspond to relations on a hypergraph having additional properties. In the case of a hypergraph with only nodes and no edges these properties are exactly the usual reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity properties for required for equivalence relations on a set. We present definitions for upper and lower approximations of a subgraph with respect to a graphical partition. These generalize the well-known approximations in Rough Set Theory. We establish fundamental properties of our generalized approximations and provide examples of these constructions on some graphs.","wellknown approximations, partitions, equivalence relations, additional properties, set, lower approximations, graphical partitions, rough set, wellknown correspondence"
"Large-scale content analysis of historical newspapers in the town of Gorizia 1873–1914We have digitised a corpus of Italian newspapers published in 1873–1914 in Gorizia, the county town of an area in the North Adriatic at the crossroad of the Latin, Slavic and Germanic civilizations, then part of the Habsburg Empire and now divided between Italy and Slovenia. This new corpus (of 47,466 pages) is analysed along with a comparable set of local Slovenian newspapers, already digitised by the Slovenian National Library. This large and multilingual effort in digital humanities reveals the statistical traces of events and ideas that shaped a remarkable place and period. The emerging picture is one of rapid cultural, social and technological transformation, and of rising national awareness, combining the larger European pattern with uniquely local aspects.","slovenian national library, corpus, largescale content analysis, italian newspapers, town, germanic civilizations, historical newspapers"
"Auto-generated Spies Increase Test MaintainabilityWe have inspected the test code for the scala. collection. Iterator trait for potential systematic maintainability enhancements. Test spies are stub objects for later verification of interactions with those objects in a testing scenario. According to our preliminary findings, using a mocking framework that supports the automatic generation of test spies, such as Mockito, can lead to a significant improvement of test code in terms of size (in some cases over 70% smaller), readability, and conveying intent by expressing expectations through a declarative domain-specific language. We argue that the resulting test code is not only more maintainable but also a better stylistic match for the Scala community than manually implemented, explicitly stateful test spies.","iterator trait, stub objects, potential systematic maintainability enhancements, test code, test spies, autogenerated spies"

"Capturing, Representing, and Interacting with LaughterWe investigate a speculative future in which we celebrate happiness by capturing laughter and representing it in tangible forms. We explored technologies for capturing naturally occurring laughter as well as various physical representations of it. For several weeks, our participants collected audio samples of everyday conversations with their loved ones. We processed those samples through a machine learning algorithm and shared the resulting tangible representations (eg, physical containers and edible displays) with our participants. In collecting, listening to, interacting with, and sharing their laughter with loved ones, participants described both joy in preserving and interacting with laughter and tension in collecting it. This study revealed that the tangibility of laughter representations matters, especially its symbolism and material quality.

"Towards new modes of collective musical expression through audio augmented realityWe investigate how audio augmented reality can engender new collective modes of musical expression in the context of a sound art installation, Listening Mirrors, exploring the creation of interactive sound environments for musicians and non-musicians alike. Listening Mirrors is designed to incorporate physical objects and computational systems for altering the acoustic environment, to enhance collective listening and challenge traditional musician-instrument performance. At a formative stage in exploring audio AR technology, we conducted an audience experience study investigating questions around the potential of audio AR in creating sound installation environments for collective musical expression.We collected interview evidence about the participants’ experience and analysed the data with using a grounded theory approach. The results demonstrated that the technology has the potential to create immersive spaces where an audience can feel safe to experiment musically, and showed how AR can intervene in sound perception to instrumentalise an environment. The results also revealed caveats about the use of audio AR, mainly centred on social inhibition and seamlessness of experience, and finding a balance between mediated worlds to create space for interplay between the two.","experience, new modes, listening mirrors, interactive sound environments, audio ar, musical expression, sound art installation, audio, new collective modes"
"A Deeper Look into Dependency-Based Word EmbeddingsWe investigate the effect of various dependency-based word embeddings on distinguishing between functional and domain similarity, word similarity rankings, and two downstream tasks in English. Variations include word embeddings trained using context windows from Stanford and Universal dependencies at several levels of enhancement (ranging from unlabeled, to Enhanced++ dependencies). Results are compared to basic linear contexts and evaluated on several datasets. We found that embeddings trained with Universal and Stanford dependency contexts excel at different tasks, and that enhanced dependencies often improve performance.","universal dependencies, word embeddings, basic linear contexts, dependencybased word embeddingswe, similarity, downstream tasks"
"The Closer the Better: Similarity of Publication Pairs at Different Cocitation LevelsWe investigated the similarities of pairs of articles that are cocited at the different cocitation levels of the journal, article, section, paragraph, sentence, and bracket. Our results indicate that textual similarity, intellectual overlap (shared references), author overlap (shared authors), proximity in publication time all rise monotonically as the cocitation level gets lower (from journal to bracket). While the main gain in similarity happens when moving from journal to article cocitation, all level changes entail an increase in similarity, especially section to paragraph and paragraph to sentence/bracket levels. We compared the results from four journals over the years 2010–2015: Cell, the European Journal of Operational Research, Physics Letters B, and Research Policy, with consistent general outcomes and some interesting differences.

"LTMA: Layered Topic Matching for the Comparative Exploration, Evaluation, and Refinement of Topic Modeling ResultsWe present LTMA, a Layered Topic Matching approach for the unsupervised comparative analysis of topic modeling results. Due to the vast number of available modeling algorithms, an efficient and effective comparison of their results is detrimental to a data- and task-driven selection of a model. LTMA automates this comparative analysis by providing topic matching based on two layers (document-overlap and keyword-similarity), creating a novel topic-match data structure. This data structure builds a basis for model exploration and optimization, thus, allowing for an efficient evaluation of their performance in the context of a given type of text data and task. This is especially important for text types where an annotated gold standard dataset is not readily available and, therefore, quantitative evaluation methods are not applicable.

"Backdooring Convolutional Neural Networks via Targeted Weight PerturbationsWe present a new type of backdoor attack that exploits a vulnerability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that has been previously unstudied. In particular, we examine the application of facial recognition. Deep learning techniques are at the top of the game for facial recognition, which means they have now been implemented in many production-level systems. Alarmingly, unlike other commercial technologies such as operating systems and network devices, deep learning-based facial recognition algorithms are not presently designed with security requirements or audited for security vulnerabilities before deployment. Given how young the technology is and how abstract many of the internal workings of these algorithms are, neural network-based facial recognition systems are prime targets for security breaches. As more and more of our personal information begins to be guarded by facial recognition (eg, the iPhone X), exploring the security vulnerabilities of these systems from a penetration testing standpoint is crucial. Along these lines, we describe a general methodology for backdooring CNNs via targeted weight perturbations. Using a five-layer CNN and ResNet-50 as case studies, we show that an attacker is able to significantly increase the chance that inputs they supply will be falsely accepted by a CNN while simultaneously preserving the error rates for legitimate enrolled classes.Subjects: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.

"Bayesian cosmic density field inference from redshift space dark matter mapsWe present a self-consistent Bayesian formalism to sample the primordial density fields compatible with a set of dark matter density tracers after cosmic evolution observed in redshift space. Previous works on density reconstruction considered redshift space distortions as noise or included an additional iterative distortion correction step. We present here the analytic solution of coherent flows within a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo posterior sampling of the primordial density field. We test our method within the Zeldovich approximation, presenting also an analytic solution including tidal fields and spherical collapse on small scales using augmented Lagrangian perturbation theory. Our resulting reconstructed fields are isotropic and their power spectra are unbiased compared to the true one defined by our mock observations. Novel algorithmic implementations are introduced regarding the mass assignment kernels when defining the dark matter density field and optimization of the time step in the Hamiltonian equations of motions. Our algorithm, dubbed barcode, promises to be especially suited for analysis of the dark matter cosmic web implied by the observed spatial distribution of galaxy clusters---such as obtained from X-ray, SZ or weak lensing surveys---as well as that of the intergalactic medium sampled by the Lyman alpha forest or perhaps even by deep hydrogen intensity mapping. In these cases, virialized motions are negligible, and the tracers cannot be modeled as point-like objects. It could be used in all of these contexts as a baryon acoustic oscillation reconstruction algorithm.","analytic solution, cosmic evolution, redshift space, matter density, redshift space distortions, density reconstruction"
"Printing materials and technologies in the 15th–17th century book production: An undervalued research fieldWe present a systematic non-invasive investigation of a large corpus of early printed books, exploiting multiple techniques.

"Overview of the CLEF-2018 CheckThat! Lab on automatic identification and verification of political claims. Task 1: Check-worthinessWe present an overview of the CLEF-2018 CheckThat! Lab on Automatic Identification and Verification of Political Claims, with focus on Task 1: Check-Worthiness. The task asks to predict which claims in a political debate should be prioritized for fact-checking. In particular, given a debate or a political speech, the goal was to produce a ranked list of its sentences based on their worthiness for fact checking. We offered the task in both English and Arabic, based on debates from the 2016 US Presidential Campaign, as well as on some speeches during and after the campaign. A total of 30 teams registered to participate in the Lab and seven teams actually submitted systems for Task~ 1. The most successful approaches used by the participants relied on recurrent and multi-layer neural networks, as well as on combinations of distributional representations, on matchings claims vocabulary against lexicons, and on measures of syntactic dependency. The best systems achieved mean average precision of 0.18 and 0.15 on the English and on the Arabic test datasets, respectively. This leaves large room for further improvement, and thus we release all datasets and the scoring scripts, which should enable further research in check-worthiness estimation.","political claims, verification, automatic identification, task, lab, clef2018 checkthat, debate, checkworthiness, multilayer neural networks"
"An Evaluation of Lexicon-based Sentiment Analysis Techniques for the Plays of Gotthold Ephraim LessingWe present results from a project on sentiment analysis of drama texts, more concretely the plays of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. We conducted an annotation study to create a gold standard for a systematic evaluation. The gold standard consists of 200 speeches of Lessing’s plays and was manually annotated with sentiment information by five annotators. We use the gold standard data to evaluate the performance of different German sentiment lexicons and processing configurations like lemmatization, the extension of lexicons with historical linguistic variants, and stop words elimination, to explore the influence of these parameters and to find best practices for our domain of application. The best performing configuration accomplishes an accuracy of 70%.

"A web application for exploring primary sources: The DanteSources case studyWe present the methodological and technical process we adopted to develop DanteSources, a Web application that allows free access to the knowledge about Dante Alighieri’s primary sources, ie the works of other authors that Dante cites in his texts. Up to now, this knowledge has been collected in many paper books, making it difficult for the scholars to retrieve it and to produce a complete overview of these data. Using Semantic Web technologies, we developed an ontology expressed in the Resource Description Framework Schema vocabulary providing the terms to represent this knowledge in a machine-readable form. A semi-automatic tool helps the scholars to populate the ontology with the data included in authoritative paper commentaries to Dante’s works. Then, the tool automatically saves the resulting Resource Description Framework graph in a triple store.

"An Extreme Value Theory Model of Cross-Modal Sensory Information Integration in Modulation of Vertebrate Visual System FunctionsWe propose a computational model of vision that describes the integration of cross-modal sensory information between the olfactory and visual systems in zebrafish based on the principles of the statistical extreme value theory. The integration of olfacto-retinal information is mediated by the centrifugal pathway that originates from the olfactory bulb and terminates in the neural retina. Motivation for using extreme value theory stems from physiological evidence suggesting that extremes and not the mean of the cell responses direct cellular activity in the vertebrate brain. We argue that the visual system, as measured by retinal ganglion cell responses in spikes/sec, follows an extreme value process for sensory integration and the increase in visual sensitivity from the olfactory input can be better modeled using extreme value distributions. As zebrafish maintains high evolutionary proximity to mammals, our model can be extended to other vertebrates as well.","visual system, computational model, olfactory, sensory information, integration"
"Weakly Supervised Object Detection in ArtworksWe propose a method for the weakly supervised detection of objects in paintings. At training time, only image-level annotations are needed. This, combined with the efficiency of our multiple-instance learning method, enables one to learn new classes on-the-fly from globally annotated databases, avoiding the tedious task of manually marking objects. We show on several databases that dropping the instance-level annotations only yields mild performance losses. We also introduce a new database, IconArt, on which we perform detection experiments on classes that could not be learned on photographs, such as Jesus Child or Saint Sebastian. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first experiments dealing with the automatic (and in our case weakly supervised) detection of iconographic elements in paintings. We believe that such a method is of great benefit for helping art historians to explore large digital databases.","weakly supervised object detection, artworkswe propose, supervised detection, imagelevel annotations, databases, marking objects"
"On Hallucinating Context and Background Pixels from a Face Mask using Multi-scale GANsWe propose a multi-scale GAN model to hallucinate realistic context (forehead, hair, neck, clothes) and background pixels automatically from a single input face mask. Instead of swapping a face on to an existing picture, our model directly generates realistic context and background pixels based on the features of the provided face mask. Unlike face inpainting algorithms, it can generate realistic hallucinations even for a large number of missing pixels. Our model is composed of a cascaded network of GAN blocks, each tasked with hallucination of missing pixels at a particular resolution while guiding the synthesis process of the next GAN block. The hallucinated full face image is made photo-realistic by using a combination of reconstruction, perceptual, adversarial and identity preserving losses at each block of the network. With a set of extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in hallucinating context and background pixels from face masks varying in facial pose, expression and lighting, collected from multiple datasets subject disjoint with our training data. We also compare our method with two popular face swapping and face completion methods in terms of visual quality and recognition performance. Additionally, we analyze our cascaded pipeline and compare it with the recently proposed progressive growing of GANs.Subjects: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.

"Fast Face Image Synthesis with Minimal TrainingWe propose an algorithm to generate realistic face im-ages of both real and synthetic identities (people who donot exist) with different facial yaw, shape and resolution. The synthesized images can be used to augment datasets totrain CNNs or as massive distractor sets for biometric ver-ification experiments without any privacy concerns. Addi-tionally, law enforcement can make use of this technique totrain forensic experts to recognize faces. Our method sam-ples face components from a pool of multiple face images ofreal identities to generate the synthetic texture. Then, a real3D head model compatible to the generated texture is usedto render it under different facial yaw transformations. Weperform multiple quantitative experiments to assess the ef-fectiveness of our synthesis procedure in CNN training andits potential use to generate distractor face images. Addi-tionally, we compare our method with popular GAN modelsin terms of visual quality and execution time.","minimal trainingwe, datasets totrain cnns, synthetic identities, realistic face images, massive distractor sets, fast face image synthesis, biometric verification experiments, facial yaw"
"An empirical investigation of the Tribes and their Territories: are research specialisms rural and urban?We propose an operationalization of the rural and urban analogy introduced in Becher and Trowler (2001). According to them, a specialism is rural if it is organized into many, smaller topics of research, with higher author mobility among them, lower rate of collaboration and productivity, lower competition for resources and citation recognitions compared to an urban specialism. It is assumed that most humanities specialisms are rural while science specialisms are in general urban: we set to test this hypothesis empirically. We first propose an operationalization of the theory in most of its quantifiable aspects. We then consider specialisms from history, literature, computer science, biology, astronomy. Our results show that specialisms in the humanities present a sensibly lower citation and textual connectivity, in agreement with their organization into more, smaller topics per specialism, as suggested by the analogy.

"Nucleotide-pair encoding of 16S rRNA sequences for host phenotype and biomarker detectionWe propose subsequence based 16S rRNA data processing, as a new paradigm for sequence phenotype classification and biomarker detection. This method and software called DiTaxa substitutes standard OTU-clustering or sequence-level analysis by segmenting 16S rRNA reads into the most frequent variable-length subsequences. These subsequences are then used as data representation for downstream phenotype prediction, biomarker detection and taxonomic analysis. Our proposed sequence segmentation called nucleotide-pair encoding (NPE) is an unsupervised data-driven segmentation inspired by Byte-pair encoding, a data compression algorithm. The identified subsequences represent commonly occurring sequence portions, which we found to be distinctive for taxa at varying evolutionary distances and highly informative for predicting host phenotypes. We compared the performance of DiTaxa to the state-of-the-art methods in disease phenotype prediction and biomarker detection, using human-associated 16S rRNA samples for periodontal disease, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as a synthetic benchmark dataset. DiTaxa identified 13 out of 21 taxa with confirmed links to periodontitis (recall=0.62), relative to 3 out of 21 taxa (recall=0.14) by the state-of-the-art method. On synthetic benchmark data, DiTaxa obtained full precision and recall in biomarker detection, compared to 0.91 and 0.90, respectively. In addition, machine-learning classifiers trained to predict host disease phenotypes based on the NPE representation performed competitively to the state-of-the art using OTUs or k-mers.

"Searching for hidden bridges in co-occurrence networks from Javanese wayang kulitWe propose that questions of long-standing interest in the study of wayang kulit, Indonesias centuries-old shadow puppet theater tradition, can potentially be posed in structural terms and investigated using the tools of network science. Here, we construct weighted character co-occurrence networks based on the Javanese wayang kulit incarnation of the Mahabharata epic, supplementing nodes with metadata specifying characters tribal affiliations and historical origins in either Indian or Javanese traditions. In order to identify characters who play unique structural roles which other approaches may overlook, we generate null model ensembles of artificial networks that share the empirical networks degree sequences, underlying episodic structures, and node metadata. By ranking nodes by the extent to which their betweenness centrality exceeds a null models expectations, we reveal characters whose appearances …","longstanding interest, javanese wayang, hidden bridges, cooccurrence networks, wayang kulit"
"Characterizing in-text citations in scientific articles: A large-scale analysisWe report characteristics of in-text citations in over five million full text articles from two large databases–the PubMed Central Open Access subset and Elsevier journals–as functions of time, textual progression, and scientific field. The purpose of this study is to understand the characteristics of in-text citations in a detailed way prior to pursuing other studies focused on answering more substantive research questions. As such, we have analyzed in-text citations in several ways and report many findings here. Perhaps most significantly, we find that there are large field-level differences that are reflected in position within the text, citation interval (or reference age), and citation counts of references. In general, the fields of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Life and Earth Sciences, and Physical Sciences and Engineering have similar reference distributions, although they vary in their specifics.

"Reply to Tosh et al.: Quantitative analyses of cultural evolution require engagement with historical and archaeological researchWe thank Tosh et al.(1) for their interest in our research (2) but note that their analyses do not undermine the main findings of our article. Their suggestion that polity population divided by polity area should be one of the social complexity dimensions raises a number of issues. What does this ratio mean at large spatial scales, where populations are concentrated in large urban centers and much of the territory is not heavily populated? How are societies distributed across this variable and why? For example, a small-scale “simple” society could have a very high population density if it has access to a rich resource base. Tosh et al.(1) do not provide sufficient information or context to meaningfully interpret their results. The study by Chick (3), cited by Tosh et al.(1), was based on the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, which is heavily weighted toward low-complexity, smallscale societies.

"Percolation strategy to improve the production of plants with high pathogen susceptibilityWe use percolation theory to propose a strategy that increases the production yield of plants with high susceptibility to a pathogen plague. This strategy consists in sowing a second variety with a lower susceptibility. The percolation threshold is determined as a function of the plant density, the mixture of plants, the pathogen susceptibilities, and the initial percentage of inoculated soil. Moreover, we provide conditions to prevent the formation of a spanning cluster of infected plants. We present an application of this strategy to a particular chili plantation. Under controlled conditions, we measure the pathogen susceptibilities to different strains of Phytophthora capsici for three varieties of chili peppers with high commercial value in Mexico. Then we simulate the propagation process of the pathogen on nearest and next-to-nearest-neighbor square lattices. We find that the production yield of plantations with the highest …","high pathogen, percolation theory, lower susceptibility, pathogen plague, high susceptibility, plant density, chili, production yield, percolation strategy"
"On misogynoir: citation, erasure, and plagiarismWe, Moya Bailey and Trudy aka @thetrudz, had significant roles in the creation and proliferation of the term misogynoir. Misogynoir describes the anti-Black racist misogyny that Black women experience. Despite coining the term in 2008 and writing about the term online since 2010, we experience, to varying degrees, our contributions being erased, our writing not cited, or our words plagiarized by people who find the word compelling. It is not surprising that misogynoir would be enacted against the Black women who brought the word to public acclaim but it is nonetheless troubling. This is not to say that every time the word is used, our names need to be mentioned, but it does matter that our intellectual interventions are understood in proper context. In this article, we interview each other and discuss the ramifications of the naming of misogynoir in digital media and its impact on our own lives.","antiblack racist misogyny, misogynoir, significant roles, black women, moya bailey"
"Professorial Inaugural Lecture: Digital Architextures: Literature, Interpretation, and ComputationWhat effect is the move to digital-first texts having upon various types of literature and our political understanding of such works? When scholars have thought, for decades, about the way in which literary works espouse political worldviews, what might it mean that, for the first time in human history, we have a broad democratic means of disseminating work? In this inaugural lecture, Professor Martin Paul Eve will discuss topics from the emergent digital-material cultures of circulation, rivalry, and economics in scholarly publishing, through explorations of the ways in which socio-philosophical paradigms of critique can be used to think about literary and critical texts, to the role of repetitious empiricism in literary research that uses brute computational force. The result will be an overview of the overlapping Venn-like mappings of contemporary literatures, interpretation, and computation.","digital architextures, literature, professor martin paul eve, emergent digitalmaterial cultures, works, professorial inaugural lecture, digitalfirst texts"

Models are representations of the properties of an informational system: a set of informational conditions that are taken to define the significant characteristics of that system. The TEI schema, for example, provides a “model” for bibliographic citations (dictionary entries, scholarly apparatus, and so forth) which identifies the features that differentiate bibliographic citations from other textual structures: its identification of author, title, publication data; its representation of the layers of the bibliographic object, and so forth.

"‘Very much like any other Japanese RPG you’ve ever played’: Using undirected topic modelling to examine the evolution of JRPGs’ presence in anglophone web publicationsWhat types of discourses characterize Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs) as a genre of video games? Why is the genre so difficult to define, and why has it become polarizing within the gaming community? This article suggests an outline of the evolution of the discourse surrounding JRPGs based on a macroanalysis of the anglophone online gaming press. Using undirected topic modelling text mining methodology to analyse a corpus of 2053 JRPG reviews gathered from ten different online journalistic outlets posted between 1992 and 2014, this article demonstrates the circumstances of the gradual introduction of the term Japanese role-playing games in online publication, first as an extension of other examples Japanese pop culture in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and subsequently as its own genre appropriated by anglophone gaming culture in the mid-2000s onwards and subjected to this community’s …","video games, anglophone web, undirected topic, gaming community, online publication, topic modelling, genre"
"The industry of evangelism: printing for the Reformation in Martin Luthers WittenbergWhen Martin Luther supposedly nailed his Ninety-Five Theses in 1517 to the Castle Church door in Wittenberg, the small town had only a single printing press. By the end of the century, Wittenberg had published more books than any other city in the Holy Roman Empire. Of the leading print centres in early modern Europe, Wittenberg was the only one that was not a major centre of trade, politics, or culture. This thesis examines the rise of the Wittenberg printing industry and analyses how it overtook the Empire’s leading print centres. Luther’s controversy—and the publications it produced—attracted printers to Wittenberg who would publish tract after tract. In only a few years, Luther became the most published author since the invention of the printing press. This thesis investigates the workshops of the four leading printers in Wittenberg during Luther’s lifetime: Nickel Schirlentz, Josef Klug, Hans Lufft, and Georg Rhau. Together, these printers conquered the German print world. They were helped with the assistance of the famous Renaissance artist, Lucas Cranach the Elder, who lived in Wittenberg as court painter to the Elector of Saxony. His woodcut title page borders decorated the covers of Luther’s books and were copied throughout the Empire. Capitalising off the demand for Wittenberg books, many printers falsely printed that their books were from Wittenberg. Such fraud played a major role in the Reformation book trade, as printers in every major print centre made counterfeits of Wittenberg books. However, Reformation pamphlets were not the sole reason for Wittenberg’s success. Such items played only a marginal role in the local industry.

"Meta-terrorism: identifying linguistic patterns in public discourse after an attackWhen a terror-related event occurs, there is a surge of traffic on social media comprising of informative messages, emotional outbursts, helpful safety tips, and rumors. It is important to understand the behavior manifested on social media sites to gain a better understanding of how to govern and manage in a time of crisis. We undertook a detailed study of Twitter during two recent terror-related events: the Manchester attacks and the Las Vegas shooting. We analyze the tweets during these periods using (a) sentiment analysis, (b) topic analysis, and (c) fake news detection. Our analysis demonstrates the spectrum of emotions evinced in reaction and the way those reactions spread over the event timeline. Also, with respect to topic analysis, we find “echo chambers”, groups of people interested in similar aspects of the event. Encouraged by our results on these two event datasets, the paper seeks to enable a holistic …","informative messages, sentiment analysis, topic analysis, social media comprising, event, public discourse, linguistic patterns, emotional outbursts, helpful safety tips"
"Visual cues effect on the impact of sonification on movementWhen designing movement sonification, its effect on peoples movement must be considered. Recent work has shown that using musical expectancy within movement sonification can impact the way people move. However, this body of work has also found that different types of movements show different effects of these musically-informed sonifications on movement behaviour. This paper addresses this disparity, by exploring how this kind of sonification may be impacted by perceptual cues. We focus on two kinds of target movements: an"" open movement"", ie one with limited perceptual cues (no visual cues from the environment and limited proprioceptive cues) at a target point, and a"" closed movement"" ie one with strong perceptual (visual and proprioceptive) cues at the target point. We present a study that investigates how visual cues may interact with musical expectancy based sonification and discuss what these …","movement sonification, visual cues, perceptual cues, proprioceptive, musical expectancy"

"13 Algorithmic modelingWhen humanists talk about “models,” we are often thinking of data models, and perhaps especially of templates that inform representation. But for social scientists, the typical shape of a model is an equation, expected to predict or explain the relations between variables. For instance, the probability that a bill will become law may be partly explained by the level of support it receives from the wealthiest ten percent of voters (Gilens and Page, 2014). So a political scientist might express the relationship between those quantities as an equation. The probability of a bill’s passage is equal to some base probability, α, plus its level of support from wealthy voters multiplied by a coefficient β. Given evidence, we can estimate α and β. Because social scientists are usually talking about probabilities rather than deterministic processes, their equations are often called “statistical” models. Of course, social scientists also do data modeling, because quantitative methods have to start from some underlying representation of the evidence. And lately it is also true, conversely, that humanists are interested in statistics. Humanists are attending to large social phenomena more often than we used to, and we are finding statistical models a useful part of that project. New techniques like topic modeling have spread rapidly, and are now being used in roughly similar ways by political scientists and historians, linguists and literary critics (Blei and Jordan, 2003; Mohr and Bogdanov, 2013).But although these modeling traditions now overlap, the relationship between them is still far from clear to practitioners.

"Inferior parietal lobule and early visual areas support elicitation of individualized meanings during narrative listeningWhen listening to a narrative, the verbal expressions translate into meanings and flow of mental imagery, at best vividly immersing the keen listener into the sights, sounds, scents, objects, actions, and events in the story. However, the same narrative can be heard quite differently based on differences in listeners9 previous experiences and knowledge, as the semantics and mental imagery elicited by words and phrases in the story vary extensively between any given two individuals. Here, we capitalized on such inter-individual differences to disclose brain regions that support transformation of narrative into individualized propositional meanings and associated mental imagery by analyzing brain activity associated with behaviorally-assessed individual meanings elicited by a narrative. Sixteen subjects listed words best describing what had come to their minds during each 3-5 sec segment of an eight-minute narrative that they listened during fMRI of brain hemodynamic activity. Similarities in these word listings between subjects, estimated using latent-semantic analysis combined with WordNet knowledge, predicted similarities in brain hemodynamic activity in supramarginal and angular gyri as well as in cuneus. Our results demonstrate how inter-individual differences in semantic representations can be measured and utilized to identify specific brain regions that support the elicitation of individual propositional meanings and the associated mental imagery when one listens to a narrative.","mental imagery, individualized meanings, brain, inferior parietal lobule, verbal expressions translate, early visual areas"
"Effects of individual traits on diversity-aware music recommender user interfacesWhen recommendations become increasingly personalized, users are often presented with a narrower range of content. To mitigate this issue, diversity-enhanced user interfaces for recommender systems have in the past found to be effective in increasing overall user satisfaction with recommendations. However, users may have different requirements for diversity, and consequently different visualization requirements. In this paper, we evaluate two visual user interfaces, SimBub and ComBub, to present the diversity of a music recommender system from different perspectives. SimBub is a baseline bubble chart that shows music genres and popularity by color and size, respectively. In addition, ComBub visualizes selected audio features along the X and Y axis in a more advanced and complex visualization.

We are faced, though, with the breakdown of the ‘rules’ of dialogue, resulting in a situation that has more in common with war than with a marketplace of ideas. I raise the question of the other side of dialogue, listening, as having an active role in constructing the ecosystem of thought in which dialogue can happen. Listening is difficult to compel, hard to measure, and easy to mischaracterize, but it nevertheless is crucial in establishing the conditions for productive intellectual exchange.","war, marketplace, listeningwhen, ideas"

"Fueling Time Machine: Information Extraction from Retro-Digitised Address DirectoriesWhereas mapping systems, such as Google Maps or Bing, have become nowadays the common tools to geocode addresses or to browse neighborhoods on modern maps, browsing a legacy map representing a geographical snapshot of historical cities is far from being accomplished. The issue is related in the first place to the lack of data allowing a system to map a given address to a throwback location. Such information are abundantly available in dedicated paper resources, such as legacy address directories1. But even digitised, mining the content of these resources remains limited due to the adhoc employed information extraction techniques.Time machine2 is a major large scale project aiming to bridge this gap, among many others, by analysing and valorising the content of legacy documents for the ultimate purpose of redrawing the historical, social and economical heritage of Europe.

"Introduction: A history of chromium studies (1955–2007)While chromium as the trivalent ion was proposed to be an essential element about sixty years ago, recent research as shown that the element can no longer be considered to be essential for animals or man. The element may be pharmacologically active, increasing insulin sensitivity in large, supranutritional doses. Glucose tolerance factor, proposed to be the biologically active form of chromium, is an artifact of its isolation. Chromium nutritional supplements have no effect on body mass or body composition. Chromium supplements have not been clearly demonstrated to have beneficial effects on diabetic subjects, although they appear to increase insulin sensitivity in rodent models of diabetes, potentially as humans have not received doses proportionally as large as those used in rodent studies.","body, rodent, insulin sensitivity, trivalent ion, element, essential element"
"Computational Music Aesthetics: a survey and some thoughtsWhile computational aesthetic evaluation has been applied to images and visual output, it is not as widely employed for generative music systems. Computational aesthetic evaluation is not to be confounded with numerical evaluation of the system’s output; such a notion is in danger of offering a reduced and impoverished interpretation of the aesthetic experience, which is innately dialogical, between the creator or the user, the sociological context, and the creative process or product. This paper reviews common computational aesthetic measures that have been used for musical applications, whilst arguing for a pragmatist perspective and a framework foregrounding the primacy of intentionality and agency in inducing aesthetic responses.","computational music, evaluation, visual output, computational aesthetic evaluation, generative music systems, output, impoverished interpretation"
"Media trade beyond country borders: five types of global cinema distributionWhile international cinema trade has been studied extensively, no work to date has examined global distribution beyond country borders. Instead of exploring media flows from production origins to importing markets, this paper analyses the shape of each film’s global theatrical run, combining information from 40 countries. The run is characterised by three main factors: the number of global screenings, the geographical spread, and the global duration in theatres. With the aid of cluster analysis, five types of distribution are identified based on the three proposed factors. The paper explores similarities and differences across the clusters using multiple regression analysis to model the relationship between global exposure in terms of screenings and movie, distribution, and origin characteristics. Results show notable distinctions between the segments with only the number of countries visited and documentary genre being uniform across clusters. This paper uses a dataset of 3,424 films from 124 origins that are released in at least two out of 40 countries included within the sample derived from the Kinomatics Global Showtime database. The unique contribution of this paper is in that it covers multiple areas to provide insight into cinema as a global market based on detailed screening-level observations constituting over 130 million showtimes.","media trade, country borders, global cinema, global distribution, production origins, distribution, international cinema trade, analysis, multiple, media flows"
"Circulation, Writing, and RhetoricWhile it has long been understood that the circulation of discourse, bodies, artifacts, and ideas plays an important constitutive force in our cultures and communities, circulation, as a concept and a phenomenon, has been underexamined in studies of rhetoric and writing. In an effort to give circulation its rhetorical due, Circulation, Writing, and Rhetoric introduces a wide range of studies that foreground circulation in both theory and practice. Contributors to the volume specifically explore the connections between circulation and public rhetorics, urban studies, feminist rhetorics, digital communication, new materialism, and digital research. Circulation is a cultural-rhetorical process that impacts various ecologies, communities, and subjectivities in an ever-increasing globally networked environment. As made evident in this collection, circulation occurs in all forms of discursive production, from academic arguments to neoliberal policies to graffiti to tweets and bitcoins. Even in the case of tombstones, borrowed text achieves only partial stability before it is recirculated and transformed again. This communicative process is even more evident in the digital realm, the underlying infrastructures of which we have yet to fully understand. As public spaces become more and more saturated with circulating texts and images and as networked relations come to the center of rhetorical focus, Circulation, Writing, and Rhetoric will be a vital interdisciplinary resource for approaching the contemporary dynamics of rhetoric and writing.

"Automatic Detection of Cyberbullying in Social Media TextWhile social media offer great communication opportunities, they also increase the vulnerability of young people to threatening situations online. Recent studies report that cyberbullying constitutes a growing problem among youngsters. Successful prevention depends on the adequate detection of potentially harmful messages and the information overload on the Web requires intelligent systems to identify potential risks automatically. The focus of this paper is on automatic cyberbullying detection in social media text by modelling posts written by bullies, victims, and bystanders of online bullying. We describe the collection and fine-grained annotation of a training corpus for English and Dutch and perform a series of binary classification experiments to determine the feasibility of automatic cyberbullying detection. We make use of linear support vector machines exploiting a rich feature set and investigate which information sources contribute the most for this particular task. Experiments on a holdout test set reveal promising results for the detection of cyberbullying-related posts. After optimisation of the hyperparameters, the classifier yields an F1-score of 64% and 61% for English and Dutch respectively, and considerably outperforms baseline systems based on keywords and word unigrams.","information overload, binary classification experiments, online, social media text, young people, successful prevention, harmful messages, intelligent systems, automatic detection"

Fake news is a noteworthy example of documents containing low-quality (eg, inaccurate) information, often created with misleading intentions that gain or gained a high popularity. This calls for an increase in the user awareness of the quality of the information they consume. To complicate things further, quality is not a monolithic and binomial concept.

"Lowering the Stakes: developing a digital viva as an end of programme assessmentWhile traditionally the viva voce examination had a central role in student assessment it fell out of favour as higher education expanded. In some disciplines the viva voce examination has had something of a resurgence in the past 10 years although it remains a very high stakes mode of assessment. This paper describes the development of a digital video viva examination to promote a more authentic and lower stakes method of assessment for students in their final under-graduate module. The module is specifically designed to enable nursing students to transition from student to their first post as a registered nurse. The programme team were keen to develop an assessment which could promote employability by allowing students to consider interview type questions around leadership, management, problem solving and self-awareness.  This paper describes the challenges of developing a truly authentic assessment when faced with the academic requirements of the programme. The use of video assessment is explored and in particular the problems associated with broadband speeds and file sharing. The authors were able to develop a more authentic, lower stake assessment with students on average recording and re-recording their viva submission 3.41 times and rehearsing it 3.67 times. Issues with digital skills of student and staff clearly effect student satisfaction when using this approach although it does highlight deficiencies in addressing these skills as part of the development of graduate attributes.","lower stakes method, digital video, student assessment, high stakes mode, programme, higher education, examination, voce examination"
"Making the Web Meaningful: A History of Web SemanticsWhile working at CERN as a contract programmer in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee submitted a proposal to his boss Mike Sendall for an information system that would help organize information distributed across the multinational laboratory without requiring researchers to agree on a standard technology or information model (Berners-Lee, 1999). This system evolved into what we today call the World Wide Web (WWW). Today, the WWW is understood as an information space where documents, or Web pages, can be referenced and linked to from other documents using hypertext links. However, the system Berners-Lee described in his proposal aimed to do more than link documents; it aimed to link data, or specific nodes on Web pages. To illustrate the system in the proposal, Berners-Lee described a complex information system diagramed with a series of nodes and arrows.

However, there remains a need to rapidly characterize and differentiate isolates below the species level to support outbreak management. We describe the implementation of a modified preparative approach for MALDI-MS combined with a custom analytical computational pipeline as a rapid procedure for subtyping Shigatoxigenic E. coli (STEC) and accurately identifying strain-specifying biomarkers. The technique was able to differentiate E. coli O157: H7 from other STEC. Within O157 serotype O157: H7 isolates were readily distinguishable from Sorbitol Fermenting O157 isolates. Overall, nine homogeneous groups of isolates were distinguished, each exhibiting distinct profiles of defining mass spectra features. This offers a robust analytical tool useable in reference/diagnostic public health …","h7 isolates, mass, outbreak management, clinical microbiology laboratories, robust analytical protocol, stec, o157 serotype o157"
"Danger and Vulnerability in the American Imagination: Crash and BurnWhy, he asks, does it seem easier for humanity to imagine a future shaped by ever-deadlier accidents than a decent future? Danger and Vulnerability in Nineteenth Century American Literature; or, Crash and Burn American invites readers to examine the “threat horizon” through its nascent expression in literary and cultural history. Against the emerging rhetoric of danger in the long nineteenth century, this book examines how a vocabulary of vulnerability in the American imaginary promoted the causes of the structurally disempowered in new and surprising ways, often seizing vulnerability as the grounds for progressive insight. The texts at the heart of this study, from nineteenth-century sensation novels to early twentieth-century journalistic fiction, imagine spectacular collisions, terrifying conflagrations, and all manner of catastrophe, social, political, and environmental. Together they write against illusions of inviolability in a growing technological and managerial culture, and they imagine how the recognition of universal vulnerability may challenge normative representations of social, political, and economic marginality.","everdeadlier accidents, american imagination, nineteenth century, crash, decent future, cultural history, danger"

In this case, it is possible to use more materials in making the leg prosthesis which by using soft material that can be printed can provide a higher degree of comfort. In the development of the prosthesis were used state of the art techniques and instruments: laser scanning, revere engineering, 3D printing TRIZ.","laser scanning, art techniques, additive manufacturing, source foot prosthesis, higher degree, advantages"
"The Shape of Time and Storifying Data Modeling Historical Processes and their Temporal Dimension in Knowledge GraphsWith the advent of more advanced computer technologies and large digitisation programs in art museums, archives, and libraries it is now possible to study the history of works of art and the lives of artists collectively using digital methods and techniques. We now have the capacity to revisit and test the conclusions of previous generations of individual researchers who attempted to identify significant patterns in the study of the arts (such as the development of styles and genres), but only had access to relatively small data sets. Recognizing the immense potential of big data a number of institutions have embarked upon ambitious linked open data projects.","advanced computer technologies, knowledge graphswith, art, digital methods, art museums, shape, data modeling historical"
"The pulse of the cycling city: visualising Madrid bike share system GPS routes and cycling flowWith the aim of shifting towards a more sustainable urban transport model, cycling mobility is being promoted in many cities and, in consequence, Bike Share Systems have been the focus of attention in an increasing number of studies over the past years. However, we know very little about the impact of these BSS in cities beyond the station level. What paths do cyclists follow? What are the most important urban arteries in terms of cycling flow? These are important questions to be addressed in order to implement policies and infrastructure where they are really needed. The main goal of this study is to visualise the cycling flow derived from Madrid BSS activity, obtained by processing over 250,000 GPS routes, and to provide an analysis of how this flow is distributed across the urban street network at different moments. We explore the diverse levels of use over the course of the day, and during the weekdays …","bike share, sustainable urban transport model, pulse, important urban arteries, cycling mobility, cycling flow, cycling city"
"AN ONTOLOGY-BASED ENRICHED EBOOK FOR TEACHING STATISTICSWith the development of Internet and the use of digital pedagogy, the production of open educational resources grows very quickly. Sharing these resources has become a major challenge both from an economic point of view, but also for the dissemination and sharing of practices among teachers. The problematics are psychologic (help for learning), ergonomic (usability, acceptability) but also documentary (reuse resources) and editorial (enhancement of digital archives). Based on an ontology developed by University of Oxford and translated in French, we developed a digital archive of open educational resources for teaching statistics. We present and discuss e-book enrichment scenarios in undergraduate statistics courses. We present how this ontology-based approach allows thinking enriched e-books as an adaptive and collaborative learning device. INTRODUCTION Teaching statistics requires the coordination of a functioning logic (the theoretical basis of statistics) and a use logic (what test to choose and how to implement it concretely). The first presupposes the acquisition of a very abstract knowledge, the second presupposes the very fine particularization of this knowledge (Richard, 1983). This coordination is based on the structure of knowledge, in particular the organization of concepts and their properties. These properties can be structural or functional (procedural-related). For example, knowing which properties a sample must have in order to be able to apply a parametric test is the first logical aspect. Knowing how to structure a data table according to the software used, or how to adapt the procedure depending on whether you are …","major challenge, resources, digital pedagogy, educational resources, teaching statisticswith, digital archives"
"Utilizing a Transparency-driven Environment toward Trusted Automatic Genre Classification: A Case Study in Journalism HistoryWith the growing abundance of unlabeled data in real-world tasks, researchers have to rely on the predictions given by black-boxed computational models. However, it is an often neglected fact that these models may be scoring high on accuracy for the wrong reasons. In this paper, we present a practical impact analysis of enabling model transparency by various presentation forms. For this purpose, we developed an environment that empowers non-computer scientists to become practicing data scientists in their own research field. We demonstrate the gradually increasing understanding of journalism historians through a real-world use case study on automatic genre classification of newspaper articles. This study is a first step towards trusted usage of machine learning pipelines in a responsible way.","automatic genre, blackboxed computational models, realworld tasks, unlabeled data, transparencydriven environment, journalism historywith"
"Topic Analysis through Streamgraph via Shiny Application: a Social Collaborative ApproachWith the increasing complexity and volume of data, the transformation from streaming information into actionable knowledge becomes more and more challenging and requires a synthesis of computational and substantive approaches. In this view, the collaboration between developers and substantive experts is essential for obtaining meaningful and strategic insights. Despite the large number of various platforms and software to develop a customized tool, the main challenge is developing social organizational forms for communication. In this paper, we explore a new method of organization workflow, namely a social collaboration via the rizzoma platform. In particular, we introduce our on-going project for developing a research-driven visualization portal that is responsive to the need of specific research in strategic studies.","shiny application, topic analysis, actionable knowledge, substantive approaches, social collaborative approachwith, streamgraph"
"Optimised Lambda Architecture for monitoring scientific infrastructureWithin scientific infrastructure scientists execute millions of computational jobs daily, resulting in the movement of petabytes of data over the heterogeneous infrastructure. Monitoring the computing and user activities over such a complex infrastructure is incredibly demanding. Whereas present solutions are traditionally based on a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) for data storage and processing, recent developments evaluate the Lambda Architecture (LA). In particular these studies have evaluated data storage and batch processing for processing large-scale monitoring datasets using Hadoop and its MapReduce framework. Although LA performed better than the RDBMS following evaluation, it was fairly complex to implement and maintain. This paper presents an Optimised Lambda Architecture (OLA) using the Apache Spark ecosystem, which involves modelling an efficient way of joining …","lambda architecture, monitoring, data storage, scientific infrastructure scientists, data, computational jobs, heterogeneous infrastructure, processing"

"Manuscripts in Time and Space: Experiments in Scriptometrics on an Old French CorpusWitnesses of medieval literary texts, preserved in manuscript, are layered objects, being almost exclusively copies of copies. This results in multiple and hard to distinguish linguistic strata--the authors scripta interacting with the scriptae of the various scribes--in a context where literary written language is already a dialectal hybrid. Moreover, no single linguistic phenomenon allows to distinguish between different scriptae, and only the combination of multiple characteristics is likely to be significant 9--but which ones? The most common approach is to search for these features in a set of previously selected texts, that are supposed to be representative of a given scripta. This can induce a circularity, in which texts are used to select features that in turn characterise them as belonging to a linguistic area. To counter this issue, this paper offers an unsupervised and corpus-based approach, in which clustering methods are applied to an Old French corpus to identify main divisions and groups. Ultimately, scriptometric profiles are built for each of them.","dialectal hybrid, features, layered objects, space, single linguistic phenomenon, manuscripts, medieval literary texts"
"Evaluating the stability of embedding-based word similaritiesWord embeddings are increasingly being used as a tool to study word associations in specific corpora. However, it is unclear whether such embeddings reflect enduring properties of language or if they are sensitive to inconsequential variations in the source documents. We find that nearest-neighbor distances are highly sensitive to small changes in the training corpus for a variety of algorithms. For all methods, including specific documents in the training set can result in substantial variations. We show that these effects are more prominent for smaller training corpora. We recommend that users never rely on single embedding models for distance calculations, but rather average over multiple bootstrap samples, especially for small corpora.","source documents, embeddingbased word similaritiesword embeddings, stability, specific corpora, word associations, inconsequential variations, training"
"Traversals: A Method of Preservation for Born-Digital TextsWork on Pathﬁnders ofﬁcially began in 2013, but it was based on crucial earlier efforts. Grigar had long embraced collection in her research on electronic literature. She had preserved copies of examples of this art form she had purchased from the 1990s onward and assembled a set of computers for use in experiencing them. In 2008, she mounted her ﬁrst exhibit of early electronic literature while hosting the annual conference of the Electronic Literature Organization (ELO). That event served as the impetus for her decision to expand her collection. In 2011, she was provided space on the Washington State University Vancouver campus to create the Electronic Literature Laboratory (ELL) in the interest of preservation and support of scholarship.","borndigital textswork, method, traversals, electronic literature, crucial earlier efforts"

"Text and Data Mining: Seeking TractionWorking in libraries affords many opportunities to engage challenges associated with text and data mining (TDM) limited access datasets. Challenges afford themselves across interactions with diverse disciplinary communities at institutions with varying resources. Increasingly, data requested by research communities fall outside the traditional purview of library collection development and research support. Solutions to TDM challenges are few given gaps in understanding and misaligned values. Continued activity in light of these factors fosters an environment where weaknesses and threats are many and seemingly tractable opportunities are few. In the space of this brief statement I will introduce four challenges:(1) underdeveloped and inconsistent content provider effort to meet text and data mining need,(2) misaligned values reinforced by ambiguous and/or overly restrictive content provider terms,(3) debt incurred by technical abstraction, and (4) purposeful technical opacity.","text, content provider, data mining, diverse disciplinary communities, traditional purview, data, limited access datasets"
"Ten simple rules for measuring the impact of workshopsWorkshops are used to explore a specific topic, to transfer knowledge, to solve identified problems, or to create something new. In funded research projects and other research endeavours, workshops are the mechanism used to gather the wider project, community, or interested people together around a particular topic. However, natural questions arise: how do we measure the impact of these workshops? Do we know whether they are meeting the goals and objectives we set for them? What indicators should we use? In response to these questions, this paper will outline rules that will improve the measurement of the impact of workshops.","interested people, wider project, simple rules, funded research projects, specific topic"
""" How a Widow Becomes a Witch: Land, Loss and Law in Anglo-Saxon Charter S. 1377""(pre-publication draft)Written for a special issue of English Studies, on “Women’s Bodies in Anglo-Saxon England,” eds. Robin Norris, Rebecca Stephenson & Renée Trilling This essay dives deep into the events of S. 1377, a late tenth-century Anglo-Saxon charter that recounts the execution of a widow, probably for witchcraft, on the southeast border of the collapsing Danelaw, and the subsequent real estate deals that her death enabled. The executed widow from this event survives now as a barely legible hapax legomena, existing only in trace form in a twelfth-century copy of a tenth-century charter–a record that documents the end of this womans life in order to erase her from the historical register and legitimize the seizure of her lands. Exploring the known and conjectural micro-history of this woman intersectionally repositions her at the center of a remarkable network of gendered, geographic, rhetorical, moral, cultural, legal, political, religious, ethnic and authoritarian values, whose forces converge at the moment of her prosecutorial killing.","rebecca stephenson, widow, robin norris, anglosaxon, renée trilling"
"Filling the Silence: Giving Voice to Gender Violence in Unas Graphic Novel Becoming UnbecomingWritten in the style of a memoir, Unas graphic novel, Becoming Unbecoming, takes readers on a poignant journey with a young girl who experiences silence, shame and blame after being subjected to male sexual violence. The protagonists story is played out against the backdrop of the rapes and murders committed by the notorious Yorkshire Ripper. This paper examines the texts multilayered narrative, which uses a range of graphic strategies and artistic styles to challenge its readers to make meaning, fill in the gaps and piece together their own version of events. The texts fragmented and disconnected sequences mimic the nature of traumatic memory, and the shifting linguistic–visual narration moves between fact, story, experience and emotion.","voice, violence, silence"

She began to sing. Her clothes were unbelievable dirty and ragged, and she, too, was unwashed. Her ash-blond hair hung down in long skeins …. But, best of all, she was beautiful, and in her untutored way, she could sing. She smiled as she sang, smiled rather sadly, and sang only a single line of a song.

"2 A gentle introduction to data modelingYou would be able to understand immediately that the text belongs to a specific text type or genre: it is a letter. A letter—today typically a personal communication between individuals—shows some specific features. Many letters bear a date and contain an indication of where they were written. They typically begin with the name of the person who is addressed, and the text is a direct communication making often use of the pronouns “I” and “you.” Based on this knowledge, one can identify the text type of our example and also identify certain groupings of information within the text:“1867” belongs with “May 24th” as part of the date, while “Albany” is obviously the place of writing—or at least, obvious to us humans. To machines, the whole text is an undifferentiated sequence of alphanumeric characters and whitespace.

"Digital Resources and Tools in Historical Researchen One of the characteristic features of modern life is the omnipresence of images-in public life as well as in the private surroundings. At latest with coining the term"" Visual history"" at the beginning of the nineteen nineties historical disciplines are dealing with this ever growing pool of pictorial sources. This is also true for educational history-especially when keeping in mind that the use of images in an educational context is common practice since early modern ages. This concerns the presentation practices, the design of didactic visual media and their use in educational practice as well as the illustrated traces of historical educational practice and historical educational knowledge (eg photographs of school buildings or educational scenes). There are various digital picture archives to address the research questions of many historical disciplines. These databases, though, differ widely in purpose and design-and of course they cannot serve every scientific demand. According to Gerhard Paul there should be at least four layers of information evaluation when analysing historical images (reality of depiction, genesis, use and impact). Thus, building up a corpus of image sources with sufficient accompanying information can be quite challenging. As major topic the Pre-Conference Workshop will focus on the impact of the discipline on developing and maintaining of a picture archive.(DIPF/Orig.)Target: Researchers; Professionals; Students; General public","educational practice, historical educational, modern life, characteristic features, picture, historical disciplines, digital resources"
"Jewish responses to anti-Semitism in Paris and London in the late 1930s as European Jewish political historyen This article compares Jewish responses to antisemitism in Paris and London in the late 1930s, when antisemitism was on the rise in both France and the United Kingdom. There were striking similarities in these responses, yet local contexts and circumstances dominate the historiographies of both cases. The main aim of this article, then, is not so much to offer new insights into the individual cases (both of which have been abundantly analyzed in historical research), but rather to fill a gap by examining the broader factors that account for these similarities. On the one hand, the article examines the nature of Jewish self-identification in the post-Emancipation era and its effects on the political cultures, practices, and identifications of the actors that were involved; on the other, it explores the way in which these practices were also shaped by migration and transnational aspects.

"setInterval (): Time-Based Readings of Kinetic PoetrysetInterval() is a study of digital kinetic poetry by English, French, and Portuguesespeaking poets whose work defies the very act of writing and reading. It places an emphasis on the historical, cultural, and technological contextualization of kinetic poetry written in diverse media. A wider study of kinetic poetry has been missing, because the field has been relatively undocumented until now. Thus, setInterval() contributes to existing literature with new research, and develops innovative methodology for reading and analyzing poems that literally move. The forms of kinetic poetry surveyed include film poetry, videopoetry, holography poetry, and digital poetry, which are all dependent on spatiotemporal elements. Therefore, there is a focus on the temporal and spatial dimensions of poems that are time-based and animated. Poems written and read with computational media require interdisciplinary expertise, because they are scripted with code and often integrate text, sound, image, and interactive functions. The creative works that are analyzed in full-depth in this study are Stephanie Strickland and Cynthia Lawson Jaramillo’s Flash poem slippingglimpse (2007), and Ian Hatcher’s JavaScript and JQuery’s ⌰ Total Runout (2015).

"Data modeling in a digital humanities context: an introductionthere is a long and rich tradition of gathering and modeling information as part of humanities research practice. From the perspective of the digital humanities, that tradition now appears in retrospect like important prehistory for an under-standing of data modeling. And that prehistory is significant not only because it shows how integral such activities have been to humanities research, but also because it reminds us of the distinctive complexities and challenges that human-ities data poses. While the terms “data” and “modeling” may be new, many of the activities and intellectual frameworks they entail are familiar and deep-rooted. In a general sense, we understand intuitively that specific theoretical approaches rely on concepts and terms that divide the universe of ideas in specific ways. For instance, literary periodization constitutes a model of history in which spans of time are associated with distinct stylistic patterns …","important prehistory, distinctive complexities, prehistory, rich tradition, humanities research, digital humanities context, data, digital humanities, intellectual frameworks, tradition"
